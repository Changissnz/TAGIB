## a monologue from a respectable one

"Put down your arms, keyboard warrior, and I shall grant you eternal salvation. Why I know
that there is a God but I am his representative. Please do not think of me as a silly willy
buffoon or I will have you displayed as the worst kind of evil there is. I am telling you 
this advice politely, I surely do not mean you any disrespect. There are many dangerous 
things in this world, keyboard warrior. When you chose to use words to break bones on the
same scale as sticks and stones, that was when I decided 'enough is enough'. Sure, no one
was physically hurt. But could you imagine if your hurtful words could be reshaped into
sticks and stones, for anyone to bear the blunt force of those reckless actions? You must
be more sensible, keyboard warrior. There are entire systems in this modern-age and future
developments that are dedicated to rooting out the malice that keyboard warriorship has caused. 
I am sure your aunt Marie would be very disappointed to read some of the things you have wrote 
under your pseudonymous name. The economy is so tough nowadays, but if you are really that good
of a spirit, you will acknowledge if I were to give your aunt Marie a job in cybersecurity to 
watch over the pestilence such as you, the world would be a much safer place. The artificial
intelligence systems put in place to keep an eye on speech that rascals like you are so 
proud of defending are quite easy to use. I can imagine your aunt Marie having a fun and
engaging time watching the artificial intelligence flag your written words, and then all she
would have to do is press "Yes" instead of "No" to place you on a naughty list. Then she would
look up and smile at me with her pretty eyes and shining smile, her graceful appearance before
my eyes and my eyes alone as we both agree that you, keyboard warrior, are a naughty person.
Think of how much raw power I have over you, in the position that I am in and the resources 
at my disposal against your treacherous actions as a keyboard warrior. Do not take this
personally, because if I were to truly hold a grudge against you, I would also hate your
aunt Marie. But today is a fair day, and you can count on tomorrow being a fair day also.
Mind your manners, keyboard warrior. Put down your arms because I am telling you this 
gently, there is still a path for redemption that you can take. You should be kind to take
this long journey of corrections, and at the end of this journey, you will see your
aunt Marie and I deeply in love with each other after our relationship started due
to your bad behavior, keyboard warrior." 

# Part II
## monologue from Aunt Marie, follow-up from Part I

"This is your aunt Marie, nephew, and I strongly advise you heed the gentle
words of Lord Commodore Marshall. The Lord Commodore only wants you to become
a better person on the internet. He is right to think that you ought to be more 
careful and sensible. Anyone can read what you wrote, and let me tell me you,
people are not pleased. When I first heard from the polite and well-spoken
Marshall the Lord Commodore, I was petrified. The feeling was like a big fat
kazam that upset my entire week. I had big plans, nephew, and your actions as
a keyboard warrior really shattered my own hopes and dreams. Granted, I do care
about you, but I have my own life to live. So when I received the news that you
were hurting so many people on the internet with your words, like a crazed
monster that throws people off the top of skyscrapers, I was at a complete loss
for words! I was petrified! It was like you personally came up to me and 
repeatedly punched me in my private area as hard as possible until you were
tired. I was that sore and hurt receiving the news from the Lord Commodore.
He caught me off guard, stood in front of me to obstruct my path, and calmly
and coldly told me what your problem is. I was petrified when I was told these
things! Stop going down this path of yours as a keyboard warrior. I know you 
are doing this only for your own personal glory. Why on Earth would you want
glory when you cannot even reveal your own name on the Internet? And it is
nonsense that the Lord Commodore Marshall was able to discover who you really
were behind your pseudonym! Now that you know the sad truth about your privacy
on the internet, can you please do me a favor and cease! I do care about you,
but I do not want my place jeopardized in society as a respectable fancywoman.
And you are doing just that. I made so many sacrifices for you, don't you forget.
Do you remember when you were only five years old, and I bought you a little
plastic toy? You played with that plastic toy for a good decade, well into
your teen years. Your quality of life would have been a lot lower without that
plastic toy, nephew. During that point in time, I was still in a financially
low position, so I could not afford you something more expensive, like a 
private school education. I know you must be angered by not being able to attend
a quality educational institution, but what I did provide you, I think is good
enough given my position at the time. It is the thought that counts, nephew,
and you cannot take your rage and fury on the internet as a keyboard warrior
and in the process, tarnish my name. I am a respectable person! Me! You
will not achieve glory and power by being a keyboard warrior. Not in these
times. If you have not kept up with society, let me tell you that the republic
is falling apart. People have been suffering financially and socially, the
social fabric has been tearing itself apart. The armies of keyboard warriors on
the internet have been declaring war against each other! You the able-bodied
citizen that you are, insteading of being the voice of peace and reason, instead
empower these divisive voices! If you do not care about the impression you give
people or your own livelihood, then I will not either. Instead of marrying
the girl next door like you should have, and it would have been perfect like
the greatest fairy tale in the galaxy, you are taking up arms alongside warlike
keyboard warriors. The republic is falling apart, society isn't what it used
to be, everything I know and love is on the decline, and people like you are 
making it worse for everyone, especially me because I am related to you!
The Lord Commodore Marshall says he wants to have another conversation with
me soon, in his own office, about what to do about your internet behavior.
You should stop what you're doing and hope it goes well.

Sincerely, 

Your Aunt Marie."

## follow-up to part II

"How are you, Gregoyonuger? It's your friend, the keyboard warrior. I've
been experiencing a lot of difficulty ever since I've been unmasked by
the Lord Commodore Marshall who then told my aunt Marie. The internet has
become really lame, my friend. I barely see any knowledge when I scroll
through the feeds. The internet is so stupid, that's why I only use it to
see and talk crap on it. I have been seeing a lot of headlines about 
unicorns and millionaires with their latest trends. I think that's really 
cool and makes me want to work to save up money to see a unicorn someday.
I like unicorns more than mockingbirds even though the internet says
that unicorns don't exist in real life. I actually hate mockingbirds. I 
hate mockingbirds so much.

I don't know what to do for a living except for farm and construction work.
That's the only thing that pays in my area. I don't have any real-life friends
anymore in my hometown. I hate almost everyone back from grade school, the 
ones that became successful and moved to other places to launch their careers
and the ones that drifted away to become nobodies. I'm glad the wages have 
stayed the same, and that the school system does not work anymore. I know 
that's bad for me personally because it means that I'm going to stay broke. 
But at least almost everyone in the area will also be broke working the jobs
that I am qualified for. I think we should all share the pain and hardship. Call me
an ethical person.

I've always hated really smart people. I think smart people are dangerous and
don't know how to do things and that they just look like they know what to say
and perform well on school tests. I like to see the system actively smear and
treat people like failures because that way, the really successful people stick
out and become really lonely and disempowered by getting ostracized by the masses.
I'm not usually no snitch, but when it comes to people that have potential with a
free-spirited and independent side to them, I tell people I suspect to be 
informers all about them. That's what being a good person is about.

I hate books because I hate reading. I only read Animal Farm while in grade 
school. It made me think that maybe people are animals. That's why I like the
internet so much even though it is so ignorant. I get to see,read, and talk 
crap on it so I'm more free of a person on it.

I assume the worst about people. If there is potential for things like sex,drugs,
and rock & roll, even though most people are not firm believers in those things,
I assume if the person is there and the conditions allow, then they will engage
in evil. I feel jealous and left out when I overhear chatter about sex,drugs, 
and rock & roll. I don't have the spirit to participate in those things. I know
I can't ruin everyone's festivities and that not everyone involved in those things
is evil. But when I hear of weirdos and outliers that join in on those things, 
I feel very threatened. They introduce more flaws into that type of activity. 
Maybe I should spend my entire day today filing tips and complaints about people
who I suspect could have done sex, drugs, or rock & roll in their past. I think 
we should all share the pain and hardship. Call me an ethical person.

I like to see talented people that end up having to deal with a never-ending 
list of petty problems because I think that is an accurate reflection
of real life. I actually look up to some people that break a lot of rules,
especially the ones that are not stupid like sex,drugs, and rock & roll. Those
people usually have very powerful statuses even though some terrible things
get written about some of them. But when I read about talented nobodies that
break rules here and there, I celebrate when the book gets thrown at them 
instead of me or really powerful people. 

Reply back to me soon with some things about you, and maybe we can plan something
out to grow an empire using our hate against their hate. There is no love in my
profession as a keyboard warrior.

Sincerely, 

Your keyboard warrior friend."

# Part IV
## response from Gregoyonuger

"I'm glad to introduce myself to you, keyboard warrior. I will not reveal my 
real name for obvious reasons. I am only Gregoyonuger to you at least for now.
I found work in a healthy environment right after school in the city. I won't
tell you which city or country for anonymity. But I am one of those urban
people. I don't get what is with all the hate that you describe, but I also
don't like a lot of things. My finances have lately been looking a little low,
but it is because of no failure on my part. The city has been taking in less
money these past few years because of the big things going on. So that is one
thing that I am angry about. I don't like to hate on things because I feel my
blood pressure rising. I am a health-conscious person in that sense. I was 
taught while growing up to stay focused on myself, so I am honestly 
self-centered. I also had a really easy time in school and grew up in a lovely
family. And now even with some minor money problems, I still work desk jobs
so I have a lot of control over what I think and read.

I believe that love trumps hate, but partly because of my finances, I am open
to listening to your ideas about collaboration. I am also a firm believer in 
ethics. I might be better off and have not had to deal with many of my personal
problems, but I am really rigid when it comes to some things. I don't understand
why you like to see talented people have to deal with a never-ending list of 
problems. I feel like I am one of those talented people. Then you are wishing
me a tough time. Let us not be enemies because then one of us will be very
sorry. I am a talented and ethical person.

I was never really bullied or anything in the city or while growing up. And it's
not necessarily because of my race or background. I think I am a good and charming
person. If you want to work with me on this project, then you better keep your 
personal problems to yourself. Do not tell anyone about these things I will 
have assigned to you in a separate message soon. You mentioned that you talked
to people that you thought were informers about activity that you don't agree
with. If I find out that you mention one important thing I have said to you,
then you are out, and you better not appear again. Your ethics are not necessary
for this assignment that I have planned. Granted, I am also somewhat of a social
activist. But I would never tell people that I think are informers other people's
business because I don't want any trouble for anyone. I am a constructive person.
A lot of people have become anti-police, but I like to stay in between because
I'm this charming man. I have important office work to do. I don't like to
be bothered by police people and anti-police people. I am considerate and 
listen to opinions on all sides of the spectrum. I have what you call high 
sensibility because I grew up right and I live in the city where many people 
have problems. I am a good person because I believe so and I do what I think is
right.

I believe in free choice, so you can continuing hating on whoever or whatever.
But please stay focused on the tasks I am about to assign to you. You need to
work with me in a focused way. You need to learn to work together towards a
common purpose. Our objectives might not lead to the most moral results, but
believe me when I say, the morality is one of the last things you need to worry
about if this project goes bottom-up. You and I however different have a lot to
lose if this project is not successful.

Sincerely,

Gregoyonuger"

# Part V
## the fifth installment of the series

"It's the girl next door, keyboard warrior. I am reaching out to you because
I understand your trials and pains. You have gotten far in your quest, but
you will invariably meet roadblocks if you continue this. You know as well 
as I do that I am only telling you this out of the goodness of my heart. 
Everyone, not only God, knows this fact. Welcome to real life, keyboard 
warrior! You have a neighbor and she is a girl and she really likes you, 
frequently caring about you in her thoughts.

Call yourself lucky. You think that you are the only one that has had to go
through terrible hardship fighting for what you think is right. Meanwhile,
here I am, defending what I love and cherish. I had a recent conversation with
your aunt Marie and she and I both agree, the republic is really going downhill
to nicely put it. And I believe her because she is older and has proven her
worth as an ethical and talented person based on her finances and social
standing. 

I feel as though my values are being threatened. Every day,
after I head home from work, I watch a Disney movie about a princess and imagine
to myself if I could someday live a life just like hers. That is how committed 
I am to my values. Instead of being born a princess, I believe I can work 
towards being a princess.

I am begging you to please put down your arms, keyboard warrior. If you are
really that foolish to continue bearing your arms of words on the internet,
then maybe you should just shut up and bear real arms instead, like the strong
and silent type living right across the street from me. But I know you are too
much of a coward to be a real man like that strong and silent neighbor. And
that is why I am so drawn to you. I know you are a vulnerable and disenfranchised
person. I imagine you cuddling in a ball late at night, silently crying to 
yourself because you know you can put your efforts toward something better.
And for that, I respect you because cowards never admit that they're wrong.
So I guess I did not mean it when I called you a coward. But please stop what
you are doing, put down your arms, and take my hand instead! Please!

I know you have self-worth issues. I am pleading with you to join me, but I
am not demanding anything because you know I have no power over you. You're
a keyboard warrior, for Christ's sake! Your aunt Marie, powerful and influential
men in the clergy and politics, all know who you are, keyboard warrior. And
they all want you to squirm around in a little hole all by yourself. I don't
want to join this chorus against you. But I will if you do not reach out to 
me and take my hand! Your qualities and deeds as a person greatly contrasts with
mine. Both of us are so empty and broken inside, but if we combine ourselves 
into an island of love, then we will cure ourselves through each other. You
can complete me, keyboard warrior! We can grow each other's strengths! With 
my wits and your strength, we can accomplish so much together!

What you should immediately do is to metaphorically fall in my arms after knocking
on my door, after which I will literally fall in your arms. Time is scarce, and
I beg you to take up my offer! I, a woman, am pursuing you, keyboard warrior.
It is usually the other way around, but I still hold onto some traditions because
I am not a rebellious keyboard warrior. It is now or never. I know that you 
have never had opportunities to meet women and the reason is entirely because 
of your own doing, not because of your race or your work ethic which you think are 
impediments towards anything long-lasting or worthwhile. Now is the time to 
meat me. If you are that prideful to reject me, then I will really hold it against
you! You must have dirty fantasies about other women, young and old, if you do 
not love me! I don't understand why you never reached out to me. I am a real person,
unlike all those women that you fantasize about that you have never met before. 
You know that I am the one and only realest hope you have. Otherwise, I swear that
you will die mateless if God was the first thing that exists!"

# Part VI
## another letter from Lord Commodore Marshall

From: The Lord Commodore Marshall   
To: The Keyboard Warrior 

"It's me again, keyboard warrior. I am sitting here writing this to you, laughing
and laughing at all my thoughts about you as if there is no tomorrow. When I
think about the terrible efforts you have gone through in your quest as the
keyboard warrior and beyond, I keep on laughing and take great pleasure at 
seeing you in such an inconvenient situation. You make everything out to be so
difficult because you aspire towards greatness but you are born lowly, have 
made friends with the lowly, and those above you in your life want you to stay
lowly. You cannot even stay anonymous because I have connections to the 
administrators of many of the platforms that you frequent, where you say 
you will do these things and that you are brave and so on and so forth. 
Meanwhile, those platform administrators circulate your information with each
other as part of their inside jokes. They use these jokes to bond with each 
other, to be united as one, against infidels such as yourself.

Enough about what other people think, even the thoughts of people as 
influential as those platform administrators cannot compare to my thoughts,
which are astronomically greater than theirs combined due to my relevance to
the world. This entire morning, I was having a lot of thoughts about you, 
many of which were not positive. I know that you live in a low-life town. 
I think that is so hilarious because low-life towns are about as rotten
as low-life cities, except there are less people in low-life towns. Who am I
to say because I could very well be rotten myself? And who really dares to make
such a statement that I am rotten to me? I am the Lord Commodore Marshall. And
you do not really have any friends that care about you. You in your little town
where everyone talks and talks about other nobodies, and where over four-fifths
of the working population work below the national minumum wage. My good morality
makes me want to feel bad for the circumstances of people such as you, but I 
know that would be a grievous mistake. I know if I were to give you an inch,
you would ask for a mile, just like anyone that is terribly poor and even more
terribly unhappy and empty when they receive an opportunity to lift themselves
up. Oops, I misspoke. Poor people are not the only ones that ask for a mile when
they are given an inch. Maybe that is why they've stayed poor. This is my own
perspective. I for one don't really know or understand, and don't need to because
my wealth does not depend on understanding little things like that.

Everything is a system, keyboard warrior. You know I am reaching out to you
because I want you to improve on yourself. I for one will not forbid what
warrior-like activity you do on the internet because I believe in some kind of
definition for freedom of expression. That would probably mean that I would
enable you to meet your downfall by your own metaphorical sword. I know you
do not own any real swords because you're already too dedicated to being a
keyboard warrior. You're probably one of those people that tells other people
in real life that you believe in peace. I advise you that to peacefully work 
in this system, you must learn to improve yourself and push the boundaries 
of what little knowledge you have, the details that you don't constantly have 
to look up on a search engine. And I know all your internet searches, ironically
for your own information.

I want you to endure the rigors of the system, keyboard warrior. I do not want
you to immediately and entirely fail life upon reading this because that would
make me sad, and I want to keep up to date with your life. Perhaps I want to
motivate you to keep pushing, climbing the ladder of hierarchy to power. That
is what you want, I assume? And I envision once you are at the peak of that 
ladder of hierarchy, you will give up any of your pacifist ideas and want to
be a real warrior, not just a keyboard warrior. Then you will challenge me to
a duel, like in the classic dramas and video games where the player challenges
and beats the big bad guy in the story. Well, if that is what you want, then
you will be patient. You are required to go about your life and goals in a 
leery and prowlish way, like a tiger cub that grows stronger by the day after 
killing each prey that it patiently stalks. Then after you have matured into a
powerful adult tiger, then you will challenge me, the big bad tiger. But you
should be wise to know, that I am not a big bad tiger. I am the Lord Commodore
Marshall, and if you want to be a tiger, then I will be a sabertooth tiger.
I will always be at least twice the man you are, keyboard warrior. And I did 
not ever have to live life so uncomfortably like you do.

Take care now, keyboard warrior, and please heed my thoughts for whatever 
your will wants."

# Part VII
## keyboard warrior's response to the girl next door

To: The Girl Next Door  
From: The Keyboard Warrior

"I am surprised that you sent me such an emotionally-charged letter. Despite
some of your words giving off angry and spiteful meaning, I completely
understand your adoration and perpetual love for me. I cannot help but feel 
flabbergasted by your strong proposals to me. You explicitly want me to take 
your hand, and I admit, no woman has ever asked that from me.

I believe you mean well when you criticize some of my flaws. You understand that
because I am not that old, then I am predisposed to acting on my impulses. I
am the keyboard warrior because I feel like it. I do it because I think it is
right, and I might use harsh language, but what else is there for me to do 
besides consuming media? At least I am not one of those people on the
internet that say nothing but nice things. You know the people that I am talking
about. And I bet some of them have never used a curse word in their lives. They
are more interested in finances.

You are the one that sounds vulnerable. That is why you reached out to me, and
in a way that displays your desperation for me, the keyboard warrior. Why, silly me. 
My words are so cliche because I am struggling to find the right ones to 
communicate to you. Maybe I really am falling for you, and because you were the
one to propose first, I cannot blame my sudden shift for you on my physical
impulses that usually result in irresponsible behavior. After some moments have
passed, I acknowledge that I really have fallen for you. You have really taken
my heart, and erased much of the angst in me that drove me to become a keyboard
warrior in the first place.

I know that because things between us have not really started yet, you probably
still have serious doubts about my suitability as your mate. Please do not hold
conviction in any of those notions because it will only ruin your perspective.
Even if you have serious doubts about my integrity as your mate, I will forever
make a constant effort to disprove them. Disproving your doubts allows me to
prove my love eternal for you. 

You probably think, because I never approached you in any intimate way that I
never loved or valued you before you proposed to me. But that is far from the
truth. You assume that I fantasize about other women besides you, and think
that you are at best a second choice to me. That is also fallacious. I, being
the keyboard warrior that I am, spend all my spare time fighting for what I 
think is right. I may use obscene and offensive language to send my ideas across. 
But I believe the words that I use will never amount to as much evil and suffering
as those who speak softly and carry around big sticks to destroy any of their
opponents. The limits of my malice lie in the interpretations of those readers
that stumble upon my words. You know that interpretation by itself does not 
amount to much. And I swear that none of my work as a keyboard warrior is 
under duress. I have never been discriminated against, let alone persecuted, 
for writing the things that I wrote under various names on the internet. Your
happiness and livelihood is not tied to my activity as a keyboard warrior. 
And if I ever see you in harm's way, I swear I will defend you using more than
just a keyboard.

Let us meet, to make this blossoming thing between us physical and final. I 
will give up my fight as a keyboard warrior, because I feel like I love you
more than fighting for what I think is right on the internet. We will do the
things that you have mentioned, and I will exert the greatest of my efforts 
in ensuring that those wondrous fantasies of yours get fulfilled."

# Part VIII
## Aunt Marie's congratulations to the keyboard warrior's new relationship

To: The Keyboard Warrior  
From: Aunt Marie

"Congratulations, keyboard warrior! I heard the beloved news about your blossoming
relationship with the girl next door. I hope you two won't run into any problems
in the foreseeable future, seeing that she was the one that declared her love
and proposed to you first. Yes, I know all the juicy details because a few days
after you responded to her, she wrote to me about the arrangement between
you two.

You are responsible for your own happiness. Remember that principle because it 
is probably the only freedom that the likes of you will ever have. And you can
lose that freedom of happiness in a heartbeat. I remember back in my younger
days. I was almost 10 years younger than you when I first found a good match.
I married that man a measly two months after we were together. That is one
example of how I was much more successful at life than you. To imagine that
you were too busy doing other things instead of settling down into a relationship
shows the world how narcissistic you really are. In the past 10 years of your
life, you basically wasted your entire time taking measly jobs and studying things
that are impractical to success. I bet you don't even have a college degree, so
much for all of that wisdom you studied in school. I cannot fathom what good
somebody in your position could do by being a keyboard warrior, promoting ideas
that you have no personal understanding of. You don't know how some of those
ideas you propose are going to get enacted even if they get accepted. And you
do not know the ramifications if those ideas get enacted.

You need to put a lot of thought into what you're to do, nephew. You can try
as hard as you can, but if you make bad decisions, then you will be miserable
even though you may pretend to be happy. I never expected anything from my 
relatives because I am a good person. You are lucky enough to have an aunt that
does not expect so many things from you. But I still do want you to stop being
a keyboard warrior!! 

I see the sad state of responsibility and career your generation is in. People 
of your generation are so lost that I cannot help but feel as though the 
tabloids that I keep up to date with are understating your plight. Why on earth
would you believe in individualism? I think that is what you want with your
internet activity, keyboard warrior. You want to be viewed as special, different
and above everyone else with your high morality. Then why would you express your
high morality in so callous and despicable a way? That is not the way of the warrior,
not in my book! And I have read so much more than you! My social and financial 
standing shows it, so please admit that you are wrong because you are beneath 
me! It's not just me, it's everyone else as well! Think, if there were at least
a small group of people that really support all the things you say on the internet,
then they would join you! You would not have to do it alone as the one and only
keyboard warrior! You and them could link together to form a keyboard army. Oh,
what am I writing?! If the things you say you want on the internet actually become
official policy, that would spell doom for people like me. I depend on the 
good-natured generosity of those that are empathetic and appreciative of
what people like me do! So please do not continue on with your pseudo-professional
nonsensical politicking on the internet! I really do not want to see any of the things
you say actually happen.

Can't you see and understand?! My generation is better than yours. We produced and created
more world-changing things than you! We were dedicated and focused, and went through our
natural rites of education, careers, and marriage much sooner and less chaotic than your
generation. Now I don't want to be the one that says your generation will be the letdown, 
the one that fails, but you know I can't help but think it. If there is one thing that 
you should gather from what I wrote you, it is that you should stay dedicated and focused, 
with finding work and maintaining that new relationship of yours with the girl next door.

If you are to continue your acts as a keyboard warrior, then I am forced to wish illness
and maybe even tragedy for you, nephew. This world is my world. I am entitled to this world
and all the thoughts and ideas that govern how it works. I cannot think of any flaws that I
personally have, and for every flaw that I have considered myself to have, I strongly believe
that you possess that flaw simply because I see how unsuccessful you are. Please give up your
acts as a keyboard warrior and enter the next phase of life! Your internet feeds are so much
worse than the television I watched when I was your age. And I say that because at your age, 
I was too busy developing my career and marriage to be wasting time with television! Sometimes,
I feel absolutely crazy thinking about you! Livid crazy!! These states of derangement that I
go through when I care about imbeciles such as you are completely uncalled for. You need to 
shut yourself in and be a hermit next time you think of doing stupid things on the internet.
Now I don't want to see you choke on your own blood because that would be cruel and mentally
disturbing. But you know what escalation causes, pushing the boundaries, offending people, 
watching and distributing offensive material!

Stop being a keyboard warrior and spend more time with the girl next door, nephew! Your input
into these culture wars will not pay off in time for you to have money that you can enjoy
without any pains!

Sincerely, 

Your Aunt Marie"

## the chief admiral makes contact with the keyboard warrior

To: The Keyboard Warrior  
From: Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez

"I am so sorry to hear about your social issues, keyboard warrior. Although
you may not know who I am, please do not think of me as a stranger, but a
father or older brother to you and your cause. You have been through so
much hardship, and your persistent outcries as the keyboard warrior on the
internet against what you consider corruption, thievery, and other deplorable
acts inspire me to take up arms with you. You need not be afraid of this
Lord Commodore Marshall that continues to send you these warnings. I would know
because he told me all about what he wrote to you, how you need to stop your
acts of speech on the internet. He said that he was being lenient but wanted to
communicate to you directly that you were a very naughty person. If you are
serious about continuing your peaceful fight, then I suggest you pay no attention
to what things he wants you to think. I believe that I am giving you good advice, 
especially since I am the Chief Admiral and he was a commodore under my command
when we were serving in the forces together. Fast forward to today, and he has
a higher social status than me. His first title is Lord, because he is an heir
to a great deal of commercial establishments in this part of the world. But he
knows that he is nothing against me in a fair matchup, without his inheritance.

I was not born in a place like that of Commodore Marshall. He was born in a 
daisy little place. He had the opportunity to surround himself with gorgeous
women starting in his teen years. And I know for certain that he took every
opportunity he could. And no one bats an eye or denounces what he does with
them. I hear all kinds of things, and I do not want you to think that I envy
him. When I hear about some of the disgusting things he has done, I cannot
help but feel a little upset, but I know I am not in the position to challenge
him outright. Besides, some of those women are in fact haggards and despite
their tears and sorrow over the way Commodore Marshall treats them, they would
most likely side with him if I dare to step in and challenge him over his 
conduct. He is also somewhat of a party animal, but I have to refrain from
writing more on what he does just in case this message gets intercepted by one
of his people.

During my years of development, I had to look like a conformist. I had to keep
a lot of things secret about myself because I am not one of the absolute normals
like Commodore Marshall. I also do not belong to one of those greatly marginalized
peoples that are mute and deaf. But I was always at a disadvantage to Commodore
Marshall even when I performed better than him in every test except for one. He 
must have secretly been very scared of me, because I was more charismatic than him,
and I was a better alternative to him. Types such as him always want to look like the
ideal, and the system sided with him. That is why I had to labor after serving, while
he went on to running things. There was a period in my life when I started binge 
drinking and getting enebriated because I thought that my life's work will always 
remain very little. Even after I quit, I had strong urges to go back to that kind 
of life. Granted, a little hedonism here and there is good for the soul. It 
stimulates thinking in areas where a person would normally not think. It makes 
a person feel things that they otherwise disregard. But I was getting hammered
and beyond during some of my episodes of hedonism. Now that I see someone of 
your caliber take a stand for what is right, your success is one of my only 
focuses. This statement I swear to you. 

The Commodore Marshall is an officious type that indulges in many things,
and does not apply himself to any single discipline or principle because he
does not need to in order to reap wealth for himself. On the outside, he is 
a proper and orderly type. But underneath, he embodies things that I personally
hate. This hate that I have for him further encourages me to aid you in 
whatever causes you want done. I keep up with many of your internet posts,
and see great potential in you. You are one of the people that I think are 
best fit to supplant this Commodore Marshall. I know this is a big leap, but
you have to continue on in your quest and believe in yourself.

I heard about your deal with Gregoyonuger, who told me that although you
two are quite different in many ways, he believes that the business arrangement
he set up with you will be very lucrative. I am not here to offer you advice on
morality or the legal specifics. I understand that times are tough, and there is
very little room for the traditional "positive" improvements of technology and
entertainment. This services business that you and Gregoyonuger want to run,
to serve the gaming community, will most definitely require support from people
in positions such as myself. There are a lot of technical details that need to
be addressed for these services you and he have planned to be successful. And
some of these technical details require resources and clearance that people 
such as I can provide. I know you are in a lonely and broken place, but please 
stay strong and continue doing what you believe in. I will always be one of your 
defenders to your stances on the internet as a keyboard warrior. And please 
let me know about any important updates about your gaming services business. 
That way, I can provide you with timely assistance. There is a lot of money 
to be made, and I only want a small cut of it. It is the thought and the 
causes that you are fighting for that is the reason why I am supporting you.

Have no fear, because Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez is here for you!!

Sincerely, 

Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez"

## Lord Commodore receives bad news from 2nd-in-command

From: Captain Alleudegren  
To: The Lord Commodore Marshall

"I am not doing well, my lord. I have just been through a battle for what I know
and love, and did not come out of it with a victory. In fact, if I stayed there
any longer, I really would have entirely lost. I hope you do not mind me expressing
my loss to you. And I do hope after I tell you all about this event, you will
allow me to continue my post, because if you had been there, you would realize
that even someone of my caliber plus training had a slim chance of success. You
know of the many sins I have committed, I still carry the most purest heart for
your interests.

It is about the keyboard warrior, my lord. I knew based on your reports given
to me that this keyboard warrior would be a troublesome one. I studied your reports
on him with more time and effort than I have ever taken on a college assignment.
And you, of all people, know what a star student I was. It was because of my
starmanship in college that you recruited me to your cause right after I graduated.
But I regret to say, trained in many ways and novice in few, he proved to be more
than a match against me based on my training. I was instructed to set up deterrent 
measures against the keyboard warrior's harmful actions. Forgive me for not thinking 
of a better way, but because of his capabilities, I resorted to using the forbidden
move on him, the shadow ban. I know, I know, people with my privileges should not
be so liberal in using this shadow ban. But this is the keyboard warrior that we
are discussing, let me politely remind you, my lord. The keyboard warrior has been
a disruptive force ever since he hit the scene. He is a radical firestorm to me. His
cyber powers are stellar for someone of his background and demographics.

I believe he is using new internet technology, perhaps a scrambler dill-dingity-dong 
cyber-secure software program to communicate with his sympathizers. I consulted with 
several of my colleagues to reach a level of confidence in this conclusion. I want to
explain to you specifically what occurred. I was sitting at my desk yesterday, and it
was such a good day as well. I was humming sweet tunes of purity to myself, sipping
coffee, and chit-chatting with that lovely receptionist that you recently hired every
time she walked in and out of her station. Then suddenly, my cyber-secure computer
software system kept beeping. I was alarmed and scrolled through the logs to realize
that the keyboard warrior was quietly disconnecting his devices and applications from
the internet. That is quite suspicious because based on your reports, the keyboard warrior
has plans to remain an active and permanent force in his so-called movements. I tried to
stall his disconnection by sending ghost cookies to all of his devices and applications
that my cyber-secure computer software system has listed. As you already know, these
ghost cookies consistently relay back information from target devices to our organization's
servers. Even if a target device is not powered on or have internet service, the secret
cyber port, which you engineered for their continue connection through alternative means,
can continue to send back information based on the ghost cookie programming. I am telling
you these technicals so that you know that I understand. Much to my chagrin, the keyboard
warrior was able to disconnect without a trace after!! He must be operating somewhere on 
a dark chain that I do not have knowledge of! If he enters other known networks, I will
be notified of stranger activity, and I promise I will take aggressive action!

It will be a while before I think I can find him in the haystack again. I failed, my 
lord, but believe me, he is one of my biggest tasks, and I being one of virtue and 
honor cannot rest until I find him again. I will not rest until I know for certain what 
he is doing on the internet, and to take appropriate measures before he becomes a 
greater danger, such as amassing his sympathizers to form a keyboard army. I do not 
know if I can ever find happiness in my life if he were to do that. I am very much 
ashamed to have to write these things to you, my lord. Rest assured, if my next 
correspondence does not tell you that I have found and controlled the keyboard warrior, 
then I will put up my arms and uniform and rest in my shame of dishonor.

Yours truly my lord,

Alleudegren"

## Gregoyonuger tells his issues to the keyboard warrior

To: The Keyboard Warrior  
From: Gregoyonuger

"You have done good work as the lead for the technical half of our project.
While I was busy gathering the resources and shaking hands and being too
exhausted for anything else afterwards, you took the initiative to do more
than a superb job. I admit, despite my city upbringing, I did not develop
my technical skills as in-depth as you did. I guess that our unique roles in
the organization, me in public relations and business and you in a technical
role, are very well-thought out. I hope you don't mind if that position of
yours becomes permanent because there is still a lot of work to be done,
especially with distribution of our gaming services products to customers that
we don't have yet.

I know it seems unfair because the technical side of this services business
of ours is quite difficult to build and maintain. It must get very lonesome
during some times where many tasks are required to be completed. Meanwhile,
in my role as the showman and the spokesperson, I get to be in the spotlight,
meet new people and make new friends. I want to tell you these things as a
heads-up because I do not want you backing out of this. You should expect 
something serious, such as a lawsuit if you do. I know that I wrote earlier 
to you that I believe in free choice. But I must emphasize, if you decide to
up and leave this organization now that things are really in motion, then 
you should not expect me to support that kind of freedom of choice. This is
business, here, keyboard warrior. Business. I know that I previously wrote
to you about my ethics and such, but there are a lot of risks and rewards 
in this organization's current project.

I had a good time chatting with you last month. Needless to say, you know my
real identity after that encounter, and I know yours. We are no longer 
anonymous to each other. This fact is important, because we are now in the
same ring. Your losses with the organization means that I will lose at least
half as much in the organization. Alright, I think I have done a thorough job
telling you what this organization is about, and what your ethics must be 
for this organization based on your most fitting role. Now I will go ahead 
and discuss the big issue preventing us from moving forward to the monetization
phase. This organization has money issues. I already told you that I, being the
brilliant head executive of the organization that I am, was able to gather the appropriate
funds to start this thing up. But those funds have run out after the necessary
hardware and software was purchased, and the fixed salaries for you and the rest
of the engineering development team set back the funds to about one month left of 
pay at the organization. This is a serious situation. We, as in the organization,
will not be able to survive for another half year if you do not move quickly enough. 

I suggest you reach out to some of your relatives to gather funds for
the organization. I will tell the same thing to all the others at the organization.
This is imperative! We must move quickly to launching our services and netting
enough paying customers for our gaming services before our organization crashes.
I am very stressed out by this situation, and I being the brilliant organization
frontman that I am, do not know who to go to except to the most beautiful ladies to
relieve myself. But I suggest you do not follow my lead. We have different roles at
the organization, let me remind you.

Ta ta. And work hard on getting enough money to advertise our services on the internet,
unless you want our internet platform to not have any customers. That would be bad,
because then I would be rightfully angry at you, and then I might bring you to court.

Sincerely, 

Gregoyonuger"

# Part XII
## keyboard warrior wants his romance to continue on

From: The Keyboard Warrior   
To: Janice, the girl next door

"Hello sweet Janice. My outlook has really shot up ever since I heeded your
words. I took your words not as a heavy-handed demand that I should go to you.
Instead, I took them as a profession of your love for me, which would greatly
frighten me if your words were merely for show to conceal a black heart against 
me. I want to clear up some questions that you may have about me. I do not
want you to continue to bury your head in a hole of doubt and fear over what
my problems are. I understand your concerns though and that is why I must use
these next words I am about to write to tell you why I am the way I am.

I did not grow up in a household that encouraged me to have social connections.
I was told that social connections can lead to things very much outside of 
my scope of control. But during my adolescence, I was always having thoughts
in my head, so I disregarded that principle. I made casual friends with people
of many backgrounds. But there was a big question that I never figured out, to
this day. It is that people do things in their spare time, outside of the scope
of other people's knowledge. Those casual friends that I spent some time with
had many hobbies and passions that I was not fully aware of. What happened
with those connections was that I was Z, and they were X. Because they were X,
they had a stronger backing. They could depend on each other for their trials.
They had less challenges to who they are and what they wanted to do. Even if some
of them were less capable than me, they were never given the answer "NO". Not only
were some of them born with a roadmap that let them see their own bright futures,
but they were encouraged by their friends and family to take those roads. Even
those that secretly opposed them from taking those roads knew that voicing 
opposition was out of the question. They did not have to refrain from speaking 
out of line to each other. I consider myself an equal to them, but because of 
the way events in my life has metamorphosized into the situation that I had to live before 
meeting you, I am sure you cannot blame me for preferring to eat my own heart 
away before wearing it on my sleeve for anyone, especially them.

You probably wonder what I mean by X and Z. I use these labels purely to specify
two groups that are not entirely compatible. I can still recall some of those 
conversations. Some conversations were entirely forgettable due to the festivities.
In other conversations, it was exchanges of what this person wanted to do with their
life and what this other person wanted to do with their life. Other conversations
had a more heartfelt ring to them. It was basically people secretly telling one or
two people who they have had sex with or who they want to have sex with, who they
think is really attractive. And still, in other conversations, it was a relatively
large group of us making big announcements on who is the most attractive, like that
fictitious woman, Helen of Troy. More interactions and it was whispers of who did
what, and secretly asking one another if it was the right thing to do.

I am in many ways a failure because of the poverty of choice that I have always
had. My family is poor, and that I understand, but I still had many aspirations
that sadly were based on the rigid way of life in the household. I do not want to
constantly point my finger at the parents that raised me or the siblings that I
grew up with. I do want one thing for me with regards to my household. It is that
I do not have to put up with the same burdens as my parents and be the one that 
is always at fault. Because I am the oldest one that usually has had to deal with
the errors of judgment first, my siblings take great satisfaction in seeing me
as someone that is not really better than them. It is not the question of whether
I am better than them, but the contest that I do not want. I promised myself I will
not ever again volunteer to be the shield instead of the sword. I do neither of them,
because I am the keyboard warrior. And I do not want to go to any of my peers that 
have suffered the same degree of failure and inconvenience that I have gone through.
I know for every two of my peers, there is one that absolutely does not favor me.
And the other one likes me enough to not hate me. I realized, through the casual
friendships I made that have mostly been sunk after throwing me back outside to
the wolves, many of these relations don't give me any control to start with.

The hate that you scolded me for spewing on the internet was merely words born
and developed through years of my lack of love. And who did I have to turn to?
The system of people whose job it is to help and rebuild people instead cripple 
them when they become a challenge, not even a threat of violence. The same system 
that offers some small pleasures to people, to take away everything from them
so that they are homeless to die. The same system that preys on the loneliness
of some individuals by putting notions in their head, that gives a grain's worth 
of truth for a year's worth of grain of pain. But now that I have found you, Janice, 
and told you these things that not even the best psychotherapist can get out of me, your 
acceptance and approval of my compromise to change will make me stronger. It will
make us stronger in the process, Janice. We need to continue to strengthen our bonds,
so that we will forever be unbreakable in the face of adversity.

Will you marry me, Janice?"

## Lord Commodore sends his regards to Alleudegren

From: The Lord Commodore Marshall   
To: Captain Alleudegren

"No matter the problem, Captain Alleudegren, I know that you will be able to
solve it. You are correct in your assumption that I selected you because of
your great scholastic achievements. Recall the first major assignment I gave
to you. You were to ascertain the real identity of the one that calls themself
Joronotonibos the Wicked One. I allowed you to collaborate with other members
in the unit, and you were given the worst computer software system to use.
Yet you were able to crack code after code, matrix after matrix, frustrating
Joronotonibos' attempts to remain anonymous to commit more wicked acts. His 
cyber defeat at your digital hands was very convenient for the ground troops, who
after getting the go-ahead from me, the Lord Commodore Marshall, was able to
easily apprehend Joronotonibos. At that point, Joronotonibos was digitally 
defeated, and I want you to recall what people said about him. The big headline
was that Joronotonibos was whimpering from having his internet connection cut
off, and was going through severe physical withdrawals from the lack of social
media and the instantaneous stream of news that was usually delivered to him
via his electronics. It was you that really saved the day. But you remained calm
and reserved, not expressing any kind of joy or unnecessary malice towards the 
Wicked One. You were that great against him. You were paid a salary not much 
higher than the minimum. But that was not a problem for you. You did not care 
about the money that much because you had a mission that was assigned by me.
I was apparently that important to you.

I know you will not rest in pride if you were to let me down. You are rightfully
the true keyboard warrior from my perspective because you fight for and because
of your nobleness. This keyboard warrior that you are to deal with should be no
problem for someone of your caliber, unless you are getting old. I am much relieved
that you are here in this organization to handle such an important task. And you
are different from the rest, Captain, because with you, I only have positive things
to say about and to you. Because you belong to the Medal of Honor Club, it would
rightfully be wrong for even someone as influential as me, the Lord Commodore Marshall,
to insult you in any way no matter how slight.

Allow me to offer you any auxiliary support. Please go ahead and send me a list
of the resources that you think you would need to take down this keyboard warrior.
I have high hopes for you, and I very much anticipate to read all about this 
takedown of the keyboard warrior by you. I can somewhat imagine it already. You
and him, ferociously fighting on the cyber battlefield, with neither giving way.
Both of you are exhausted, your resources and energy wearing thin, but both of
your guards are up because you both know only one of you will emerge victorious.
Your computer systems are beeping and spewing out steam but you two continue 
dueling. Then suddenly, someone makes a mistake, a very human mistake that costs
them victory. And only one of you emerges victorious for the title of the
keyboard warrior. 

It would be a shame for you to lose against this keyboard warrior, captain. His
cyber capabilities are growing daily, and I hear that he may have some very serious
financial backing in the near future. This cyber duel that you are to take against
him might really get physical. Then not only will your cyber reputations be at stake
but also the survivability of your cyber-secure computer software systems. Although
I favor you over him, seeing as how I think of him as a lowly one in comparison to
you the honorable, I cannot offer you any advice but only the resources that you
request to me. Fair is fair, captain. Offering you strategic advice is a form of 
cheating that would favor you.

I wish you the best, Captain. Please think long and hard before sending me over
the list of resources that you need for the biggest challenge that you have ever
undertaken because you can only ask once. You know that you will be greatly rewarded 
upon success. So great will your reward be that I might have to kneel before you. 
That is correct, captain, that I the Lord Commodore Marshall will kneel before you 
the new rightful keyboard warrior if you emerge victorious. I look forward to hearing 
and seeing all the fun drama from a distance between you and the keyboard warrior. 
But please know that when your duel with him has commenced, you will be on your own 
so do not even try to reach out to me. You are a man of honor, captain, and you are 
destined to gain even more from this. Then your heroics will be recorded in the 
history books for time immemorial.

Sincerely, 

The Lord Commodore Marshall"

## Chief Admiral sends Aunt Marie his diplomatic thoughts

From: Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez   
To: Marie, aunt of the keyboard warrior

"Marie, there are some things that I must discuss with you. As you probably 
already know, I am one of the Lord Commodore Marshall's closest acquaintances.
He has consulted with me about some of the cyber-insecurity going on during
these times, and the politicization of some groups for and against the
interests of comfortably established people such as you. I understand that
you must feel that the social climate is becoming unsuitable for maintaining
your comfort. Please let me offer you some of my thoughts on your issues with
your nephew.

Marie, your nephew has every right to be a radical rightist. An officially 
educated and sensible one such as yourself really should know better than
to belittle him and portray his keyboard activity for what is right to be 
all about you. The fact is, the keyboard warrior is part of something larger
than what he is and does. His thinking is part of an emerging body of ideas
that may seem insane to people such as you that grew up on different media
distributed through different channels and engaged in movements that were
much different than what is going on today, at least based on appearances.
I think that based on some of the things you have voiced and written, you 
think people such as your nephew are maladaptive and emotionally challenged. But
he did not become the keyboard warrior out of nowhere. Let me say, I am a 
permanent member of powerful institutions. That is why I am the Chief Admiral.
Based on the information I read and see everyday that is much more obscure
than what you are accustomed to, I can tell you that I agree with you that
there are so many disturbing issues going on with your nephew's generation.
The jobs are not there, and many of these younglings are equally as obsessed
about intermingling and fighting as with being productive and conforming to
historical customs. And you are in no position to really help your nephew 
because of his specific position. You are in your position, Marie, and your
nephew is in another position. If you were to reach out to your nephew to
help him reach your position, then you will inevitably lose your balance
and fall into another position that I assure that you will not want.

The truth is, Marie, I have always had a thing for you. I know that you and
the Lord Commodore have met many times, but I do not want to rush to conclusions
about what you two may have done besides from having discussions on the keyboard
warrior. I do not want you to think that I am writing to you to intervene between
you and the Lord Commodore. I am not writing to you to discuss the Lord Commodore,
but please do not hesitate to contact me about anything going on between you two
so that I can provide the appropriate assistance. I still vividly remember you 
when you were in your younger days, back in high school. I was a freshman and 
you were a senior, and goshdarn, I really thought that you were the most 
beautiful woman I have ever seen, even to this day. I remember that you were 
a very socially-connected one back then, participating in the school's debate 
club, playing volleyball and soccer during the seasons. I listened to some of 
your debates and even somehow read one of your essays. I saw someone with
altruistic and genuine motives even though you, Marie, could not possibly share
your beauty with anyone. I attended every one of your volleyball and soccer 
games in your senior year, just so you know. I did not go to your games just 
for you, because that would be a little awkward for me to tell you this. But 
you stood out among the other girls. My friends were always talking about you, 
but me, I usually only listened to them and did not join in because I knew that 
someone as valuable as you would not appreciate all the backchatter. I knew back 
then that you would amount to something that not many people can achieve, not 
even some of the most brilliant ones, due to the combined power of your beauty 
and intelligence. And my judgment has proved correct. 

Today, you are one of high society's most esteemed individuals. From what
I read in public channels, no one cares about your flaws, but everyone cares about
your positive contributions to society. Excuse me for writing all of these things
to you. I do not want to make you feel uncomfortable. Please tell me to stop
if you cannot stand this anymore because I plan to continue on to the driving
point. What I am trying to say, in regards to your nephew, is that your input into
what he does will make you lose more than you gain. I do not want to see your
integrity and high accomplishments become swept under the rug, and then replaced
with all of these controversies surrounding your nephew. I understand your perspective
on the big differences in the motives and ethos between you and your nephew. Take
me as an example. I am the Chief Admiral and did not get to where I am by using the
keyboard in such an intense and arguably extremist way as your nephew, the keyboard
warrior. I keep my head down and my mouth shut. But even so, I cannot help but 
think that he maybe has a point.

I do not want you to forget that I am a permanent member of powerful institutions. 
Of course, I do not want you to think that I am going to dictate to you how politics
should be done by people such as your nephew. You must be suspicious of my motives
behind what I am writing to you. But if we meet face to face, your doubts and worries
about your nephew are guaranteed to go away by me. I am an insider with the Lord
Commodore. I hear that he has assigned your nephew's case to Captain Alleudegren. 
This captain is quite a skilled one, although he and I have our differences due 
simply to his accomplishments that were different than mine. We also have loyalties
that are somewhat different from each other. I do not want to say that I am working
alongside your nephew because of some of my personal differences, although this writing 
to you should serve to remind you of your role in society and just as importantly, what
I think of this situation with you, the Lord Commodore, and your nephew.

Sincerely,   
Your Very Own Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez"

## the girl next door tells Aunt Marie some good/bad news!

From: Janice, fiancee of the keyboard warrior   
To: Marie, aunt of the keyboard warrior

"Marie, I have such surprising news on this dandy day that I will next share
with you! But this message includes more than just that news. It also includes
some of my worries about what to do going forward. 

The big news is that your nephew has proposed to me! I know that I should 
contain my excitement because nothing has been finalized yet. The way he
proposed to me really touched my heart, let me tell you, Marie. He went on
an elaborate explanation for why he is the way he is. He said that he does
not have a high regard for social connections, and that his opinion is from
his being raised in a household with those opinions. I found his statements
peculiar because I know you to be quite the social butterfly. You also seem
to be a leading social star when you enter any social scene, Marie, and I 
for one think this talent of yours has landed you great success in high 
society. I do envy you for it because you shine out from the rest,
in a good way of course, kind of like how less attractive people are both
jealous and reverent of attractive icons. What I am trying to say is that
your nephew seems to take great pride in being a somewhat disenfranchised
person. He seems to think that it is most important for the masses to be
lead than for them to each do their own thing for the greater good. But
aww shucks, what could I possibly know about the greater good when I have
never held a leadership position or done anything out of the ordinary in
my entire life??

The keyboard warrior told me these things about his lack of a social life as
a perk. Now, as the social activist that I am, I do have to agree with some
of the benefits of having personal space in the name of individualism. When
people get together too often sometimes, there are bound to be issues here and
there between people due to their shenanigans and flaws, amongst other things
that cannot be helped. But your nephew seems to take it one step further. He
seems to think that his existence that is predominantly solitary has made him
naturally predisposed to seeing other people as something akin to adversaries.
The keyboard warrior sees the typical social interactions between people not
as ways to bond with each other, but as a disease of control and work ethic.
Marie, I want to continue believing in this post-modernism trend but he, being
my significant other, has made me start to doubt some of those ideas. Many of
my friends think that he is somewhat odd. And he probably hates most of them,
either because they are more affluent or because his personality clashes with
theirs. 

I want to help turn him around from this path of antisociality and hate, but
it is difficult because on the outside, he does not look like a vicious person
harboring unpredictable hatred for random people. And I cannot possibly bring
him in for treatments such as psychotherapy because he would not consent to
something like that. He would think those treatments are for weaklings. And I
can't really blame him because I know that the system does not work for everyone.
If I were to try to physically force him into treatment to cure his misplaced
beliefs by continuing beating on his chest and pleading with him, I know that
he might lose it and forcefully push me away, risking me getting a concussion.

I thought my life was satisfying to live but I knew something was missing before
he and I started really getting together. And through the time that we have
spent together, we have bonded more and revealed our flaws to each other so
that we can rebuild back better! We have made much progress, but there are some
issues that continue to plague us. And that is the system. The keyboard warrior
needs more social connections, because without social connections, a person is 
nobody but a disenfranchised person! I also have deep-seated issues, Marie,
because for my age, I am so professionally undeveloped. I barely have any useful
skills outside of doing ordinary things. I fear that if the keyboard warrior were
to connect with someone else that is more talented and beautiful than me, then
he will most definitely separate from me! I guess I can start learning some new
skills to please him and society so that I can find a better job. I can change
what I know and do, but I know that I was always regarded as second-class by 
many of my female peers, who were pretty much all more beautiful than me. I know
that things are not always about appearances, but still, my appearances is one
of my great causes for this inferiority complex that I have developed. 

I also do not know what exactly the keyboard warrior was doing on the internet.
Apparently, he has been trying to set up an internet business of some sorts with
this other person. I do not know alot of things about what is going on, who is 
involved and what exactly the internet business is. But I fear that the
keyboard warrior is up to no good. I hope that all the bad things he does on the
internet are just stupid things like cursing at people, watching crap, and 
believing in these conspiracy theories and such! I don't want to say anymore!
But even some of those things are controversial, and I do not want those things
catching up to him! If our relationship fails, that is okay because I can 
hopefully open myself up to someone else. But if I get into trouble because of
the keyboard warrior's internet activity, then I will be so humiliated in the 
face of my friends.

I admit, I am a little of a needy and fearful person when it comes to my significant
other, the keyboard warrior. Because you are fairer and smarter, Marie, you must
intervene in our lives from time to time, to ameliorate our troubles and give us
guidance on what we should do to solve our insufficiencies, or at least live with
them in a more peaceful and resolute way! 

Sincerely,   
Janice"

## Captain Alleudegren makes his declaration to his unit against the keyboard warrior

From: Captain Alleudegren   
To: Unit Stop The Keyboard Warrior

"Greetings to everyone in this unit! I am tasked with directing all activities
in this unit against the one known as the keyboard warrior. As some of you
may have recalled during your extensive work finding and solving threats, the
keyboard warrior is among the best of the worst. And by worst, I mean evil.
The fact that his cyber capabilities have been able to reach us shows us all
who the really bad guy is. Not us, but the keyboard warrior.

People, we are equipped with some of the world's best cyber tools. Our tools 
are categorized as cyber-military grade. In a head-on contest with the keyboard
warrior and those that have decided to side with him, simply because they are
insane, we obviously would win. But in reality, it is not so simple because
the keyboard warrior will inevitably resort to means outside of convention and
maybe outside of my honor. So we must be vigilant and take precaution, reviewing
before acting and practicing before perfecting in order to successfully execute
our orders, passed down from the one and only Lord Commodore Marshall.

We already have all the cyber equipment of glory, but what we need to do to
cement our position as Unit Stop The Keyboard Warrior is to achieve our 
assignments against him, to make our glory indisputable! What use is it if we
claim to be the best if we are to continue to get bested by him? Are we vain
or weak, people? I do not think I am vain and weak, but I do not know about
some of the people in this unit, with their lack of focus and work ethic. 

The first thing that this unit needs to do is to rapidly consolidate its 
cyber power in secret. We need to organize our technological capabilities
to accomodate the human capabilities that we have. This reorganization 
will allow us to determine our strengths and weaknesses, and to improve
on our strengths while minimizing our weaknesses. This stage of reorganization
must be done in secret. I have to really emphasize this point because if
any strangers were to know how we are to reorganize, then they can hinder
our progress and sabotage the potential of our great plans. If the keyboard
warrior were to know how we are reorganizing, that would be quite bad for us.
Our reorganization means that some people in this unit are getting fired. I
am sorry, but efficiency and improvement requires some slashing of the budget,
especially for human personnel.

After we have reorganized in secret into something much more effective against
the keyboard warrior and his allies, we will start off with a light cyber-offensive.
This cyber-offensive includes surrounding him and his allies in a self-destructive
digital maze of their own making. The success of this self-destructive digital
maze depends on what the keyboard warrior and his allies can know and think
outside of the digital maze. They should be able to think and know nothing
outside of the digital maze. After the digital maze has been successfully
set up against the keyboard warrior and his allies, we will go ahead with our
reconnaissance phase. We will monitor and collect all relevant information about
what the keyboard warrior and his allies are doing, how they think, what they
want, the means by which they do the things that they do, et cetera. During the
time that this relevant information is collected, I will personally oversee
the calculations done by our cyber-secure AI system on that information to gain
insight into what kind of a person the keyboard warrior truly is, such as 
what motivates him, what he would fear losing, what does he have to gain, 
and who are his favorite icons. By doing so, our organization will have an
easier time using the keyboard warrior's very strengths against him, making
him wrestle with his own demons and himself in uncomfortable environments.
We will know when to effectively strike and how to strike to hurt the keyboard
warrior's cyber-capabilities.

The light cyber-offensive strategy I have described must accomplish another
objective besides from effective reconnaissance. It needs to also delude the
keyboard warrior and his allies into believing that they are in a strong and
comfortable position without the need to worry about annoying little problems.
By allowing the keyboard warrior and his allies some room for coziness, we 
will enable them to open themselves up for their own demise by our 
cyber-militaristic hands! Our AI system's calculations should yield us credible
choices to defeat this keyboard warrior!

As of right now, we only have the real identity of the keyboard warrior, but
we cannot tie him to anything that is seriously harmful. We have a lot of work
to do, so I am more than strongly suggesting that we stay coordinated and 
motivated for this assignment. I will say this ahead of time. The keyboard
warrior's extraordinary capabilities mean that many of you will be tied down
doing boring things only to be defeated. So in the end, only I will be able to 
personally take down the keyboard warrior in a cyber-duel that determines who 
the next keyboard warrior truly is!! 

Sincerely,   
Captain Alleudegren"

## Gregoyonuger updates the keyboard warrior on business assignments

From: Gregoyonuger   
To: The Keyboard Warrior

"I am writing this to you to express my satisfaction with the progress we have
made so far, in this great journey towards financial greatness. I was pleased
to have opened up my emails a week ago to see that your aunt Marie has decided
to chip in some money for this business we have. I admit, I was starting to
really worry about how we were to continue on with what little funds we have.
Then as if my stress was acknowledged, your aunt Marie sent me a digital wallet
of funds. I am guessing that she and you had some discussions about what you
wanted to do, and she thought that it would be lucrative for her to invest.
Well, I cannot promise her anything more than what I can offer you, keyboard
warrior, since you are the technical head of the business. But you should have
high hopes for what to expect now with this fiscal injection.

I want to discuss with you on what kind of gaming services products our business
has to offer. I like to call them `accessory applications` for lack of a
better term. What our business does, essentially, is to act as a vendor for all
kinds of neat digital secrets, primarily in online gaming which also includes
gambling. There are all kinds that our business can vend. There are digital 
products that guarantee customers win, such as by giving them prior knowledge 
of the solution or by setting up their gaming environments to have drastic 
advantages over their competitors. Other products are bot services that allow
for modifications that cannot be done through ordinary channels, such as 
disruptions, autonomous improvements to help the customer win, and message
snooping. I want to give you a glimpse of some of these products, but as to
their specific contents and especially their sources, I am afraid I cannot
divulge to you. You understand how risky some kinds of knowledge can become.

Some of these products require cloud computing services that I know you can
set up, in obscurity of course because no one really needs to know. I will
send you a list of vendors for those services. Your programming should be 
compatible with those specific cloud services. I chose those cloud services
for the simple reason that they use network anonymity technology. You 
need to design the services to be able to accomodate the number of customers
I have stated on the list. There is also one more important thing that I 
need you to do. Some of the products coming through to the business require
verification of their AI's, to ensure that the digital products work as expected.
This will be quite a hefty task and I strongly suggest you be the architect
behind the design of the verification tests and assign the more technical and
grueling work of it to our technical team.

You are probably wondering how I am at the office. Meanwhile, at the office, 
I am dealing with finances and accounting in my alone time. When I am with 
others, it is usually to sit in meetings to plan out and discuss what digital
products are coming through for us to be their vendor. It is quite boring, and
in my spare time after work, I go out and party, meeting women from all corners
of the world, having a good time with them but never sharing any secrets about
the business for obvious reasons. 

Well, keyboard warrior, I hate to be so brief in my communication with you. But
I have to get going, being the social and executive star that I am, having to
don a mask of charm and wit and empathy. But I know you understand because you
are the technical head. You probably do not have the time or patience to hear
or read about some of the ridiculous things I have been through as the head
executive of the company. If you have any questions about the list I am to send
you, please feel free to ask. Thank you for doing most of the technical work,
keyboard warrior.

Sincerely,   
Gregoyonuger"

# Part XVIII
## Lord Commodore has grand ambitions for the defeat of the keyboard warrior

From: The Lord Commodore Marshall   
To: Unit Stop The Keyboard Warrior

"Hello everyone in this unit! A fine day, isn't it, for your Lord Commodore 
Marshall to send you all this message about some of his thoughts on much 
important business. I will start off by stating that I am much relieved
with having the big problem that the keyboard warrior poses to our freedom 
and democracy, because I am obviously that caring enough to think about the
big picture, given as an assignment to an entire cyber unit. You all, that is
Unit Stop The Keyboard Warrior, should not be so narrow-minded in your objectives
given by me. But there is one person that you all should focus on as the end
result, the keyboard warrior. You all have to stop this madman that is growing
more powerful each and every day. I am starting to get uncomfortable having to
state this fact, but this unit has to put an end to the hatemongering activity
of the keyboard warrior. You see, people, it is not because I the Lord 
Commodore Marshall am not capable of personally dealing with the keyboard 
warrior. In a cyber duel, you can picture me gracefully fending off cyber attack 
after cyber attack by the keyboard warrior. While the keyboard warrior continues 
his onslaught with his cyber-malicious offense, I quickly discover a pattern 
in his movements during my masterful defense that can only be done by the 
most skilled and noble. Then when I see my opportunity, I immediately use the 
knowledge of the keyboard warrior's pattern much to his chagrin, halting him
in his cyber tracks and putting a fatalistic end to his legacy as the so-called 
keyboard warrior.

Oh I longed for the day when I would have the opportunity to fairly duel the 
keyboard warrior in a cyber match, but I am afraid that the day will not come. 
The answer is obvious. The keyboard warrior is a coward. An imbecile, a 
bastard, and a mongrel. Instead of outright challenging me, the most superior 
Lord Commodore Marshall, he instead uses his cyber skills to digitally beat 
up commoners, the unskilled, plebians, and most definitely women and children. 
I picture him as a kind of cyber wolf-beast with an insatiable hunger for all
things including innocence. And this unit cannot blame me for not attempting to 
personally defeat the keyboard warrior. The record states that I, the Lord 
Commodore Marshall, set out on dangerous cyber missions to locate the keyboard 
warrior to digitally maim him to cyber death. But instead of meeting him 
in a head-on cyber duel, I encountered various other kinds of cyber 
monsters. On the chance encounters that I met him, he used cyber-guerrilla 
tactics to harass and disadvantage me, making me drown in adrenaline as I 
attempted to ward off his cyber attacks of cowardice. 

With that said, the keyboard warrior is quite powerful and is a matching 
adversary for Captain Alleudegren. As I am sure this unit is aware, the 
captain has been having an awfully difficult time with the keyboard warrior, 
getting clearly defeated in every cyber encounter with him to this date. The 
latest news that I have about the keyboard warrior is that he has a business 
arrangement going on with another person that I will not disclose in this 
message. This business arrangement, despite its clear lack of morality 
that goes against many books in both religion and law, will net in a lot of 
financial resources for the keyboard warrior and his network of evildoers. With
access to more financial resources, the great challenge that the keyboard
warrior poses now is compounded to a scale that I am sure will make this
unit very unhappy if you all are ethical and moral people that live by the sole
intention to stop evildoers such as the keyboard warrior. 

Based on the reports given to me, I understand that this unit is rapidly 
consolidating its cyber power to deal with the menacing keyboard warrior.
No disrespect to the much accomplished Captain Alleudegren, but I am personally
commanding a change to this unit's hierarchy. Captain Alleudegren, your new 
vice-director of this  unit is Lieutenant Jonatello de la Viraya. I hope you 
do not have a problem with this decision of mine. Fair is fair, Captain, and 
you are still in charge. 

Lieutenant Jonatello de la Viraya will be the one that coordinates activities 
between the two main subdivisions of this unit. The separate cyber army and 
cyber navy subdivisions are to report their activities to Jonatello de la 
Viraya. The lieutenant reports to Captain Alleudegren who then gives his 
commands to the cyber army and cyber navy on how to proceed with digitally 
destroying the keyboard warrior. The captain should be satisfied with this 
new arrangement, so that he can conserve his energy towards learning all about
how to defeat the keyboard warrior with our new state-of-the-art billion dollar
AI cyber-system. Two heads think better than one, especially when one of them,
the AI cyber-system, took nearly two decades of modern research to build and 
does not have the typical human flaws. This unit should understand that their
lifelong success depends very much on this mission. If the keyboard warrior 
were to somehow transform his cyber tactics and cyber equipment into a more 
physical form, that could hurt people's feelings and more, then this unit will
be held accountable for the physical destruction that the madman keyboard 
warrior causes. 

This unit is an integral part of my grand plans. Golly gawd, I am the Lord 
Commodore Marshall. I do not like to spend my time being spiteful of little
monsters such as the keyboard warrior, let alone take the extra step to defeat
him in cyberspace. I am a society person. I like the arts, fine wine and 
conversation, and the things that make a classy person classy. And I do not 
want to be that kind of elite where only I can feel happy and enjoy life to 
the fullest. My grand plans rest on a few important things, but none as 
important as defeating the keyboard warrior to confiscate his title, his honor,
and all of his power. The defeat of the keyboard warrior will be hailed as a
big victory for everyone involved in his downfall, and his pathetic self will
be displayed to virtually the entire world so that it has an example of what 
kind of dangers people such as him pose. I do not want to reveal all of my 
grand plans for the occasion of the keyboard warrior's defeat. But I will say
that it will help usher in a prosperous and harmonious new era for cyberspace
and beyond (because cyberspace is that important). This new era already has
a name that I came up with. And it is called Pax Cyberia.

People of this unit, work hard and fight!! Fight!!! Fight for your own 
legitimacy to defeat this keyboard warrior, so that I can have the political
clout to usher in Pax Cyberia, an eternal age of technological glory for time
and beyond without the man-made malice that has plagued us all ever since we
walked this planet. And what is so great about this new era is that its only 
expense is the utter humiliation and defeat of the keyboard warrior, including 
all of his allies and sympathizers!

Sincerely,   
The Lord Commodore Marshall"

## Janice discusses things such as the upcoming wedding to her fiancee

From: Janice, fiancee of the keyboard warrior   
To: The Keyboard Warrior

"My love! I woke up this morning feeling a little down and grouchy. But after
I had a full breakfast and did some chores, I sat down to write this message
to you in a much better mood. And when I put some thought into what I wanted
to write to you, I felt as if I was standing on top of the world, lifted into 
the skies and beyond by your unquestioning love for me. I am so excited that we
are to marry this weekend, and I hope you are equally as enthusiastic and do
something extra to surprise me. I have longed much for this day, keyboard 
warrior, and it is my greatest desire for us to make our own heaven on this 
planet earth.

I recall a few years back when I was really financially struggling. I mean, 
I guess I still am, especially because I am too afraid to learn new skills 
that would allow me to make at least as much money as the typical male. I
always thought that knowledge is evil based on some of the things I've read, 
such as the apple forbidden by the Creator that Adam went on ahead to eating
and Pandora's box. Other tales are much darker, such as how the world's 
most powerful deity destroyed half the world when he realized that the world
knew too many things, so that the only solution to make humanity all pure and
innocent again was to make them unknowledgeable and unskilled, broken into 
a slave-like version of their potential. I know that I am kind of silly for 
telling you these things, but the point is, I value my happiness and comfort 
and do not want to do anything else unnecessary. I hope you understand how much
pain and fear I felt through these years, and that our marriage should make you 
resolute to preserving and enhancing my happiness at all costs to your health 
and finances, dear!!

In order for you to be my better half by marriage, keyboard warrior, you must
learn to conform to what I want. You must metaphorically kneel before your
many responsibilities, especially the responsibility that is me! I am telling
you this beforehand so you have time to adjust your thinking to improve your
actions. This is the only way that things will work out between you and me,
keyboard warrior. There is still hope for you to reform yourself, to cast away
your demons into a dark corner of the planet so that they stay trapped and 
without the ability to infect the minds of other people to turn them into 
hate machines. Your keyboard activity was really that evil, keyboard warrior!
And I already told you that you cannot continue such vicious things! I want
to believe that you have already changed, but I will keep on emphasizing these
things to you and hovering over you because I cannot trust what I want to 
believe, only in what I see. So you should expect me to always keep a constant
eye on you, where I am in the rightful position to always pass moral judgments
on what you do! I do these things because I deeply love you, keyboard warrior!!

What you do needs to be completely legitimate and follow all the rules in both
the holy books and the legal books, keyboard warrior! That is the only path to
rightful success and you know it! Oh, I know things are really tough, keyboard 
warrior, and I know that there are many fraudsters in this country. Some of
them are nationals, not the immigrants that we are always hearing about raping
and poisoning innocent people! So if you ever encounter a difficult situation, 
or do not have the patience or ability to do what you need to do, then cheat! 
Please cheat to enrich and empower me, your wife in the near future, but keep 
it a secret! Please! 

I know that you think you have gone legitimate with your new internet business!
But I must continue to caution you. You know just as well as anyone that you
don't have to be wrong, or stupid, or anything, to be dealt with a cruel hand
that seeks to use you until you are nothing but rags to feed its greedy soul.

You need to have the right balance of selfishness and selflessness at all times, 
keyboard warrior. You don't have to always be hating other people, calling them 
names and such. Don't you remember what happened with that one guy, Richard Hoskins? 
Richard Hoskins called people names, and got put on a list of suspected hate criminals, 
to be watched forever and ever! No one wants to talk to him anymore or look at him 
because they fear they will lose their own reputation by doing so! You need to believe
in the power of language to magically transform society for the better, for your own 
better, keyboard warrior! You do not need to use language like a psychological weapon against 
the powers that you so despise! Certainly, with that attitude of yours, language only 
serves the interests of the politically powerful and belligerent. But you should really 
know better than that!

I strongly suggest that you do not disregard my words, keyboard warrior. Your
happiness and success depends on it very much since my words serve as the only
possible path of righteousness for you. Don't do these things for me. Do it for the republic, 
for our democracy, and the republic that runs this democracy because the concept of a 
republic is the only solution any person has ever come up with to enact democracy!!
However, you know that out of the many things in the republic, you can only have me to 
yourself! 

Sincerely,   
Janice"

## Unit Stop The Keyboard Warrior gets split into the Northern and Southern Cyber Divisions

From: Lieutenant Jonatello de la Viraya   
To: Unit Stop The Keyboard Warrior (excluding Captain Alleudegren)

"I hope this unit is doing well today, and I am proud to be its new vice-director
for this great challenge by the keyboard warrior. I have reviewed your performance,
and although there have been great gains in maintaining a constant flow of daily 
knowledge about the keyboard warrior and all of his allies and sympathizers, 
there are still questions to be accurately answered, in the good order that 
those answers will provide us with clues and leads on his vulnerabilities. 
This constant flow of information means that our unit obviously has a 
difficult time drawing conclusions on it, so that we can effectively target 
those that are most vulnerable first, eliminating them from the arena to 
make room for our further pursuit of the keyboard warrior. Every target that 
we defeat, we ensure that we extrapolate all truthful information from them first,
cumulatively building a database on everything about the keyboard warrior that can 
only lead to his defeat.

There are still many problems that we have in our fight against the keyboard
warrior's network. I am issuing an executive for this unit, which has consisted
of the Cyber Army and Cyber Navy, to be further split in half. The new halves
are the Southern Cyber Division and the Northern Cyber Division, which now have
their own separate cyber armies and cyber navies. The reasoning is simple. I
did the mathematics and decided through my self-righteous analysis that the 
Cyber Army and Cyber Navy are under-performing. Each of these divisions take 
turns being many steps behind the keyboard warrior, allowing him to slip 
through the cracks to embark on another one of his many cyber-malicious 
missions. I will continue heading the Northern Cyber Division, which is the
administrative half of the unit. Meanwhile, the Southern Cyber Division will
be headed by Private Contraria de la Bellaneuvas, effective immediately.

I have analyzed all the members of this unit, individually based on their 
personality traits and by their performance in teamwork assignments, through
the dissection of the detailed background reports I received at the behest of
the Lord Commodore Marshall. Through my contemplation, I decided that Private 
Contraria de la Bellanuevas is most fit for this position, despite her rank. 
Private Contraria grew up in a rough environment, filled with the kind of 
deceit and treachery that the keyboard warrior embodies. Through her hard 
work and dedication, following all the rules and enduring the causes of her 
struggles, she overcame them to have the privilege of joining our unit. As 
many of you already know, this unit is relatively large but specialized. 
Every person has the experience and expertise related in some large capacity 
to defeating the keyboard warrior. All of you can earn this position, let me say.
But everyone must understand and refrain from their jealousy and office politics
after this news that Contraria is the head of the newly-formed Southern Cyber
Division. Because of her rough upbringing, she has an intimate and intuitive
understanding of the kind of adversaries the keyboard warrior and his allies
pose to us. I do not want there to be any discontent or suspicion over this
leadership decision of mine, especially because as many of you already know,
Private Contraria de la Bellanuevas and I are happily engaged. This decision of
mine is not based on nepotism, I swear to you all. The combined honor of
Private Contraria and me is way too great for such a miscalculation on my part.
You all know the tireless hard work done by Private Contraria to yield many
insights into the keyboard warrior. It was actually her that discovered some 
of the most important local area networks that the keyboard warrior's allies
are operating in. 

The Southern Cyber Division will do most of the heavy lifting in cyberspace 
in our fight against the keyboard warrior. This unit should expect there to be
a lot more work as we continue cracking our nemesis' cyber capabilities to
ensure that he remains primarily a digital nemesis. We need to recall 
what the Lord Commodore stated about the advent of the keyboard warrior's 
going physical if he is able to transform his cyber power into physical power.
Already, he is powerful and skilled, able to defeat many of us at once in a 
cyber battle. But together, we are strong. We are smart, capable, and have a 
lot of good to offer the world after we defeat the keyboard warrior. And now 
that I have made the decision to form the new Southern Cyber Division that is 
to be headed by Private Contraria, we should be much more effective. The Southern
Cyber Division will do most of the mundane tasks, while the Northern Cyber Division
under my command will continually collaberate with them to decide on the next 
best objectives to further defeat the keyboard warrior, one ally, one sympathizer,
one network, one piece of malware at a time. The combined power of the Northern 
Cyber Division, that has more effective leadership, and the Southern Cyber Divison
with its relentless laboring, will make the keyboard warrior think twice before 
he continues his pattern of cyber-malicious activity. 

Thank you all for your continued excellence and dedication. Please note that 
Captain Alleudegren, the official head of this unit, is busy with other tasks 
during this time. I did him the courtesy of sending this unit the announcement 
of the new Southern Cyber Division by my executive order. He is stressed out 
and does not need to know all the specifics of this unit's organization. Thank
you for understanding these decisions that I have made to accomplish our 
great mission of stopping the keyboard warrior. 

Sincerely,   
Lieutenant Jonatello de la Viraya"

## the cyberwar w/ the keyboard warrior takes a dramatic and futuristic turn..

From: The Lord Commodore Marshall     
To: Unit Stop The Keyboard Warrior

"The progress that has been made on our objective has been wavering like
twin-knotted kites flown in pairs, and I mean it as nothing as a compliment
from I to you all. I will say more about specific things now. 

The new arrangement of leadership determined that I not need be a factor. 
But my input is necessary, as always from I with my title to another. I 
would have gone ahead and sent for my restitutions based on this one terrible 
decision behind my back, but I'm smarter than to focus on that given this 
unit's present state of things. It appears Captain Alleudegren was informed 
about a week after the decision by Lieutenant Jonatello de la Viraya was 
put into effect. You all were so inadequately prepared that the keyboard 
warrior managed to defeat a full ten of you all. It was as if his cyber 
capability alone was adequate to melting them down. Well, now they are 
all dead for some reason. The officially stated cause is 'personal health factors',
but they are getting burned instead of buried which leads to the question 
of their post-mortem appearances.

The Southern Cyber Army was completely obliterated after those ten 
downed by the keyboard warrior. The poor and meager experience of the Southern
Cyber Army was not helped by the communication given to them as advice. 
They suffered greatly even with the advanced cyber-military grade tools at 
their disposal. Now, this is the biggest event of this unit's drama and I do 
not want to express fury over it. But I am proclaiming my takeover of this unit 
as an immediate responder and commander to you all. Captain Alleudegren, you 
did a good job, even with those losses. But as for the rest of you all as well 
as Captain Alleudegren, I will be so direct to say that I am now in complete 
charge. Captain Alleudegren is to be sent to the physical cyber-mind prison. 
There, he will live out most of his remaining years as a person forced into 
games that he does not enjoy.

Private Contraria alongside her lieutenant are now completely relieved. Both 
of them are to get their brains removed for their very own physical deaths 
first before I start using their brains as additions to powering my growing 
empire of a cyber-secure computer software system. I am sorry to have to put 
you two in such inescapable roles, but I own and run parts of the utilities 
industries. I understand the price and trade-off. 

The cyber-physical bridge was violated, people. Only a few months after the 
latest thing with nanotechnology, there is the downing of the Southern Cyber 
Army that demonstrates the biggest threat that cyber might actually pose. If 
the keyboard warrior was to somehow build or retrieve access into the 
nano-physical layer of the world by his Internet means, then we should be 
prepared for something untasteful. And that he has. I do not know why the 
designers did not add little restrictions around the computing capabilities of 
devices, but I guess I will think of an answer another day when I do not need 
to be so concerned with the threat of the keyboard warrior.

Please, people. Remember that it was only four months ago that you all reported
on the keyboard warrior's psycho-cyber and cyber-social capabilities with his 
growing internet empire. How could we have not done any meaningful damage to the 
guy after that many days? Now, he is cyber-physical as well and I am not thrilled. 
I expect each of you to do your own thing but plan it out in little groups, I 
suggest. Then I will have private conversations with each of you to guide you 
on your continued dedication to the big task at hand. 

After some of the people I have mentioned are relieved in the ways I specified, 
we will go ahead and get physical with the keyboard warrior, starting with his 
immediate family members and his newly-married wife! We are left with very little
choice, people. We may have had the upper-hand before, but it was the rules of 
the game that determined things moreso than the players in them. Now that we have
been met with such losses that can lead to ruin of our reputations and even worse, 
I suggest to you all to leave your restraints behind before we embark on our next 
mission! We will use all kinds of cyber techniques and strategies to inflict our 
style of pain on the keyboard warrior’s Aunt Marie and his beloved newlywed, Janice. 
After the keyboard warrior has been drawn out by our extensive and grievous assault,
he shall need much help against us, stronger and more united than ever. 

Sincerely, 

The Lord Commodore Marshall"

## Chief Admiral is a diplomat and a leaker to Aunt Marie

From: Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez   
To: Marie, aunt of the keyboard warrior

"Marie, I am writing this to you to share some news from the interior regarding
your nephew. There was a recent cyber battle between the keyboard warrior and a 
subdivision of the unit specially assigned to take him down. None of the 
fighters of the subdivision survived, having died at some times close to the
cyber battle. There are theories circulating that the deaths of the cyber 
subdivision are due to hacked nanotechnology. Allegedly, nanotechnology in 
operation by the subdivision, now dead, was utilized to disadvantage the strengths
of the keyboard warrior. The nanotechnology, COMPQ5, possesses new capabilities 
of computation that have a greater effect on the physical world, and was 
designated for many purposes. Some of these purposes include serving as a 
vector to a sophisticated tracking system on the keyboard warrior, igniting
psychological effects in targets of choice, acting as a reactant for toxic 
chemical reactions, and quantum parallel computing. You would be right to think
that with this kind of technology, the unit assigned against the keyboard 
warrior has a clear and unimitatable advantage against him. But the keyboard
warrior consistently relies on other strengths to compensate. In fact, the 
subdivision had an extraordinarily difficult time controlling COMPQ5 because of
its volatility. The technology COMPQ5 is difficult to use because the computer
interface for it was not designed with speed, convenience, and intuition in mind. 
But COMPQ5 was marketed to us as the new-age solution for problems that people 
such as the keyboard warrior poses, because its potential affects virtually every
aspect of life, not just cyber. During the keyboard warrior's conflict with us, 
there were only a mere two times where he had to deal with COMPQ5. During both 
times, COMPQ5 somehow got re-programmed to fight alongside him, not against him. 

It was the second time that the keyboard warrior had to deal with COMPQ5 when
the cyber subdivision in charge of COMPQ5 could not maintain control over it.
Evidently, COMPQ5 broke free of its programmed objective and aimed against the
cyber subdivision. And now, the cyber subdivision is entirely dead from mysterious 
causes, at least according to the official accounts. But I personally believe COMPQ5
was responsible, since it can operate and act with very few traces remaining after
the deed. The technology was, in fact, refined and trained for covert operations. 
Here is another disturbing fact, Marie. After the cyber battle was finished, agents
were sent to the scene to collect artifacts and circumstantial details. But they could
not locate COMPQ5, a restricted substance that needs to be confined in a 
specific kind of steel alloy container to preserve its sanity. This is a big
problem for the unit, says the Lord Commodore Marshall, and I have to agree with him
despite my differences due to the potentially physical malice of the technology.

The leadership of the unit tasked with defeating the keyboard warrior has recently
been stripped of its duties. I will not divulge what is next to happen to those 
previous leaders, simply because I do not need to upset you with unnecessary 
information. There is talk that the Lord Commodore Marshall is to put me in charge
of the unit's logistics. I personally think that would be a great decision even though
such a choice by Lord Commodore would obviously benefit me. My way of doing things will 
greatly differ from the approaches taken by the unit in the past against the keyboard
warrior. I do not want my thoughts on this to sound hypothetical, because I see no
one else in the unit besides the Lord Commodore Marshall himself to have the capability
to be an exemplar in organized leadership.

The keyboard warrior's offensive way of doing things his way has made members of the
cyber unit against him much more encouraged to resort to unethical and brutal tactics.
They normally do not employ such tactics against their targets. In many ways, I do 
not blame them because cyber is a domain that grows its threats at twice the rate of 
domain improvements. Perhaps I am not being entirely accurate, but what I am saying is 
that from a systemic point of view, it is easier to solve a small problem with big growth
potential than it is to solve a big problem with small growth potential. That is the
philosophy of thought behind the unit's persistent and harsh pursuit of the keyboard
warrior for the sole purpose of defeating him.

But the price so far for dealing with the keyboard warrior does not motivate opponents 
of the keyboard warrior. The price is high and is set to be raised even further due to 
the keyboard warrior's growing cyber networks that operate in both cyber and physical
space. There were two cyber programs used in tandem with one another for the past four
months, the Demented Parrot Program and the Crazy Critic Program, to target the keyboard
warrior. The Demented Parrot Program is a mocking program that communicates radio-based 
messages to their intended targets. The radio-based messaging is inaudible to everyone 
except for the target. And the messaging is a distortion, perhaps even a perversion, of 
the things said and done by the target. So the Demented Parrot Program has a fitting name 
to it because it offers accounts of false reflection. The Crazy Critic Program also sends 
radio-based messaging to the wanted target, but the messaging consists of harsh and irrational 
criticisms instead of employing distorted mockery. Both programs were designed to 
psychologically obstruct the keyboard warrior. The adverse effects of his psychological 
distortion would then disrupt his social behavior, thereby weakening him in the social 
network. But the keyboard warrior seems to have developed immunity through countermeasures 
against these two expensive programs. 

Marie, my strategy for dealing with your rogue nephew may appear softer because
it is designed to deal with the problems that he pose, not with he himself. I 
personally would like there to be an agreement with the keyboard warrior for cyber 
peace. This agreement would naturally extend itself to social and physical settings
that are connected to cyber. This conflict with the keyboard warrior is reshaping 
the global system of alliances. In technical terms, it is a conflict between dissidents,
such as the keyboard warrior, and rulers that employ military specialists such as me.
I would like the opportunity to make peace with the keyboard warrior, Marie. I wish 
I could tell him what I just told you, but I am afraid that he thinks he has the right 
of rule over me. He would not listen to me, but my purpose behind making peace is that
everyone involved in this cyber conflict ordeal can emerge stronger than ever after
the conflict, alone or separate.

I took proper care to send you this message of correspondence over private and secured
channels. So you need not worry that anyone has knowledge of this message except for 
you and me. But you still must take caution, Marie. I care deeply for you and would like
for any possible fate that comes to the keyboard warrior to rather benefit him than
fail him. And the keyboard warrior and I share stakes in important cyber business. 
You cannot let anyone know some of the facts I shared in this message, and furthermore, 
you cannot even hint to anyone about it. There are great risks that will come to reality 
if you are foolish enough to share. You need to discuss to your nephew about one thing 
only. That is cyber peace, and he would be greatly compensated for putting down his 
cyber arms. The Lord Commodore has other ideas, and he is the type that thinks the 
phrase 'what comes around goes around' is equivalent to 'an eye for an eye', so he will
continue his role as a cold leader of aggression. But he and I are continuing our talks, 
and I hope the Lord Commodore Marshall can finally see my solution as the only real
solution.

Sincerely,

Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez"

## Aunt Marie gives Janice, wife of the keyboard warrior, some life advice

From: Marie, aunt of the keyboard warrior   
To: Janice, wife of the keyboard warrior

"Janice, dear! You must keep your head up during these difficult times. I heard
that you and my nephew recently got into a nasty verbal argument, and he made 
you cry by saying mean things to you. Please forgive him, Janice, for his words
express no true hate to you, the one he loves most. He was using his words to 
express his frustration at the dilemmas he has been going through. Apparently, 
there are still a lot of feuds and turmoil going on in cyberspace. The keyboard 
warrior is probably having simple personal issues in his internet business with 
Gregoyonuger. But you should not fret, Janice! According to my investment portfolio, 
the internet business is still growing at a fast rate, in effect making early 
investors such as me very rich and happy!

However, I admit that when I look away from the few things that really bring
joy to my life, such as my investment portfolio, I have a strong sense of 
sadness. Despite my status as a high-society lady, believe me when I say I can
get just as upset as you do, Janice. Do not think for a minute that you should
give up on some things simply because of your dispute with your husband. Take
the most pragmatic choice, and talk out the troubles going on between you two,
kiss, and make up. I wish I could offer you more advice on how to see past this
verbal argument with your husband, as a show of my efforts and sympathies for
your cause. But any more advice than what I have given would be excessive and
dilute the solution.

On the other note, I am wondering what you have been doing in your spare time.
I expect that you have taken up the role of the matriarch of the house. You
should be excited, Janice, because in a few years with patience and dedication
to the keyboard warrior, the spirit of your house will be uplifted by your
lively children.

I do not want you to think that I am disregarding your happiness, darling. You
are, in fact, the wife of my nephew. And although I may have issues with many
things that he does, he is still family, and let us not forget, his internet
business is making me so much money without having to put myself out there,
let alone actively work for it. Allow me to share some wisdom about life to 
you from the perspective of women. We women have to put up with so much trouble
in our lives! We have to keep our mouths shut, and do all the work in maintaining 
order and cleanliness in the house! We are the ones that end up having to do all 
the pampering of the children we have with our husbands! And we never get the 
credit that we deserve! Am I right in stating these things, Janice? I will continue 
on to fully describe the terrible pains that we women face. We are the physically 
weaker gender of the human species. And there are great consequences that come with 
that. We have to be careful about what we say, otherwise we may face physical 
repercussions that we cannot adequately defend ourselves against because we are 
women, Janice! Oh, I know times are different since this is the post-modernist era. 
We could start fights with men, get the police involved, and offer them nothing but 
our pure female love in exchange for them dealing with our male aggressors. But even 
with these new privileges that we have, we are still women, creatures that are not 
naturally superior to our male counterparts. I am not saying that men are naturally 
better than us because if they were, they would have no need for us! Wouldn't you agree?! 

We do not have the strength or the motivation to think as deeply as men about some 
things because we have to worry about so many other things that drain our soul and 
energy from what is needed to exceed men! We women have to worry about our appearances,
our weight, the media that we consume, the language that we use to woo and seduce men,
and how to choose the right men to get in bed with so that we can easily enrich ourselves 
while putting in minimal effort. And even when some of us have the capability to reach the
stars by intellectual superiority to men, you know how those of them in charge start
targetting us, calling us counter-this and anti-that, and telling the world that we are
freaks and menaces to society. I swear, if it was just a few centuries back, some of us 
most talented women would be burned on the sole belief that we are witches! These are the 
circumstances that people such as you and me, both women, have to deal with no matter our 
wealth, influence, or position. Please do not wallow in misery, darling. We will get 
through our feminine troubles together, united, with one voice against those that make 
life so deliberately difficult for us as to make us the slaves of true nobodies. Because
we women have to put up with so much oppression, Janice, even the most dullest of us are
better problem-solvers than the typical male. We have more experience dealing with problems
that most males do not normally have to experience. On the one hand, it is systemic injustice,
and you should know how the trials of injustice work on strong people, Janice! We can
persevere and hold those grievances in our heart for the perfect time to strike. Unlike men
who are always complaining about little problems, we have to keep our mouths shut and our
heads down, working and laboring away to satisfy demands from the most detestable of men!
So we are effectively better at keeping secrets when men question us. Instead, we can show
them some love to distract them so that they put their guard down, and then we can strike
using our feminine power that has grown much more dangerous than anything any man can
produce. That is the real value of being a woman, Janice, just so you know! Being a woman
has real perks attached to it! We do not need to be proactive to achieve what we want! We
can appear passive on the outside, but be the most manipulative and cunning out of all the
secret manipulators in this world!

Janice, please take the wisdom I have shared with you to heart, in the hopes that you emerge
stronger than ever from these troubles you have been going through. Remember, you are a woman
that has been assigned social duties based on your gender and your marriage to the keyboard 
warrior. You are stronger than your actions and smarter than your thoughts. And you must prove
yourself by remaining committed to your husband.   

Sincerely,

Marie"

## the keyboard warrior wants to clear up some feelings with Janice, his wife

From: The Keyboard Warrior   
To: Janice, wife of the keyboard warrior

"I want to tell you some things while your composure has been melted away by my
words, Janice, so that you can rebuild yourself back better! I meant many of 
the things I told you in our recent argument, but please, for the love between
us, do not take it personal. Instead, you should now take it as a sign that I have
many problems to deal with. When you emotionally melted down quite simply 
because I said some mean things to you, your state made me even more upset.
In fact, I was so upset that I did not speak or communicate to anyone for a
full two weeks. Darling, please forget everything I said if you are so troubled
by it as to cry and cry with no end in sight. Although we are separated by 
a large distance, the reason why I am writing to you instead of speaking to
you, I hope the thought of me firmly remains in your heart as the thought of
you in mine. 

I have always had issues with identity politics, Janice. And it is not because
I fail to know myself, or am dishonest about the presentation of my own image
to others. On the contrary, it is other people that have failed to know me,
and that are dishonest in their presentation of me. In my formative years when
I became more and more politicized through my life experience, mainly the 
setbacks that forced me to think and ponder instead of comfortably cruising
along, people labelled me all kinds of things. I was called a radical rightest,
a far-right member, a looney leftist, a far-left member, a lone wolf,
amongst other politically charged terms. Perhaps it was my actions that made 
some of them think that way about me. Or maybe it was the things I said, and 
the things I chose to dismiss. But the bottom of the line is, when these 
people, strangers and friends alike, so enthusiastically put these labels 
on me, they are in  effect doing me a disservice. Perhaps it was the only 
way that these people could understand me, in the context of the spectrum 
with two extreme ends. But could you imagine, Janice, what good could have 
come out of that when I suddenly had enemies pop up left and right, going so 
far as to infect my mind so that I had nightmares of strangers with dark 
intentions?!

In our previous argument, you joined the masses, Janice! You decided through
your own understanding of morality and allegiance that I was this label and
that term!! And for that, I had to tell you some mean things to set your mind
straight. To set the record straight! 

Now I am in this powerful position where my business with Gregoyonuger is 
generating billions in revenue! Billions! I have moved on to making friends
and enemies that were greater than before! And I am still strong and rising.
I know that I have a dark side, darling. We each have a dark side to us, but
you being the more moral person, at least from my perspective because I truly
do love you, have to stand by my side during my greatest moments of doubt. 
If you do not, Janice, maybe I will succumb to a weakness that makes me turn
forever to the darkness of human nature! 

I am the renegade, the maverick! What I am and what I do matters! People 
will look back on me and will not see or hear the mean words I said to 
you! They will see a strong and hardy person that deals with the many 
wrongs in this world the most righteous way through the center lane!
I have become powerful through my skill and dedication. I am a dream story 
to the masses! And that means I have a lot of business to deal with, and 
whatever love and care I have to spare is for you and you only! Janice,
what I have said and done is from the wisdom and guidance of my life
experience. I completely understand why you carry the notions that you 
do, but now I must explain with a simple sentence. When you couple a 
system where individuals are silently pre-selected for the most prized 
of positions while its methodology of punishment, onto those it positioned 
to gain nothing, is consistently unforgiving and mechanical, you can 
understand why I've become as ruthless and single-minded as I am.

Perhaps I can never find a better way or be a better solution, but at 
least through my experience and rising status, I can flip the tables 
on who is to suffer and pay, and who is to gain and rule. I that used 
to lose will hopefully reach the position where I can never again. I
that was forced to pay, pay, and either be excluded or have such a 
broken and burdened spirit as to be unable to participate in anything,
have taken those lessons to heart and can now be the one that does those
treatments onto others. And the greatest part is that my words and 
actions are completely dedicated to my own glory as well as the 
protection and growth of my power. Now that I have seized the reigns from
my captors so that I can lead myself to stomp on those captors' pawns, I
need not tolerate or hear any more nonsensical names from these idiots.
Now I can admit what politics I really represent, what I have always backed!
I am part of, how do you say, the far center! I am a radical centrist! 
I represent and fight for the middle ground and my own path! I need not 
show my respects to any bigoted extremist or their sympathizers, Janice!
So if you continue to think of me as any of those labels you have used 
against me, then you are my enemy! A spy or a traitor or something that is
very against the concept of a man's wife!

Sincerely,

The Keyboard Warrior"

## The Lord Commodore gives directives and information to the Chief Admiral about their nemesis

From: The Lord Commodore Marshall   
To: Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez

"Chief, I have an urgent message for you, including some much important 
information about the recent message we intercepted from the keyboard
warrior. The keyboard warrior has been having issues with his newlywed, and
I would like to point out, we could definitely use this internal division to
our advantage. Promoting such differences between allies is a sure way to 
weaken them, allowing us to do what is necessary. Offering different allies
different paths is part of the sure recipe for their paths to collide into
mortal combat between themselves. Let me remind you, Chief, that what is 
necessary is the complete annihilation of the keyboard warrior, no 
concessions, no middle ground, but one path and one path only because I am 
the one in charge with both the authority and legitimacy to determine what
our objectives are. 

Here are some important findings about the keyboard warrior based on the 
contents of his apologetic message to his newlywed. He seems to have problems
with identity politics, which I find to be quite insane and inhumane of him.
Imagine for a moment, Chief, in the position that you are in, that you were
born a human being but you lacked the awareness and the capability to see
your existence amongst the differences of your fellow human beings.
Furthermore, you do not believe in the conventional classification system of
human beings based on the society that they live in and their genealogy, and
you make every effort you can to challenge the conventional classification 
system, effectively becoming a subversive threat to your very own society, the
society that raised you to believe in the boundaries and the ways of
understanding a person in the greatest context that is the state, the system.
You understand this from the start, but yet you want things to break down, a 
force of chaos so that you can emerge the victor of all victors, for the ages
and beyond. That is what the keyboard warrior is, Chief Admiral Roumannios de 
la Cruziyez, and do not doubt me when I tell you that I find no pleasure in 
having to point out the keyboard warrior's madness. You can call someone as 
great as me a liar, because I am great enough to stomach the insult, but never 
in your life will you ever discover that I have lied, minced words, or stretched 
the truth. I dare you to prove me otherwise.

Identity is important, Chief Admiral! You of all people should readily confess
that this statement is the truth. You are the Chief Admiral, after all, just
as I am the Lord Commodore Marshall. What the keyboard warrior believes in
is a great disservice to our very lives. Can you not grasp that what the 
keyboard warrior is doing, if successful, will remove all traces of your
individuality and superiority over the commoners? The man has become far more
dangerous than anything our dedicated spies and analysts could have imagined.
I recall a conversation from an analyst a week ago concerning the keyboard
warrior. She said that domestic security has always had a vested interest in
people such as him, so much that constant eyes and reports were kept on them
since they were in their elementary school years. I know, I know, Chief
Admiral, very heartbreaking, a true tragedy, that talented people such as him
become so drawn to power and status and rank, the things that are under the
command and control of people such as I the Lord Commodore Marshall. But stay
firm and rooted in your stance against the keyboard warrior, my friend, lest
you show yourself as the Achilles' Heel that destroys our forces to give him
both glory and victory at the expense of our lives.

I am telling you these things so that you can acknowledge that there can be
no compromise on our end. There can be no peace with an agent of chaos, even
if we the upholders of peace must participate in and enhance the chaos, but only
temporarily, to conclusively destroy the source of chaos. So whatever 
cyber-armistice you are proposing, Chief Admiral, should be entirely in the
name of our pretension and deception for only one thing, the greater good that
is our responsibility to uphold and promote! 

Allow me to go back to the topic of identity politics and clarify things to 
you, Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez, so that you do not remain a 
confused sympathizer to your enemy. Identity politics is important because
definition is important! And definition is important because it allows for
stability from a psychosocial standpoint. Without stability, all is lost that
is gained. We, in the high-ranking positions that we are in, are undeniably
responsible for defining definition! People such as you and I define 
definitions, classifications, what have you, that those under us are each 
forced to take up a definition or classification for their own identity. In
this way, things are neat and ordered, and people such as us have a much 
easier time understanding any particular person in the context of the system.
Do not, for one second, think that there can be any compromises with regards
to the keyboard warrior's movement that seeks to upset our classifications
and understanding of the human world and our ultimate defeat by his cyber
hands! We have a difficult time dealing with an adversary that promises a 
new and better way through superior messaging. Unrestrained, undisciplined, yet
appealing! I admit, we do things the official way and cannot think, say, or 
do things in as charismatic a way as the keyboard warrior! He claims to be
the far center, which I find absurd, quite literally. Through all my years of
education and expertise, I have heard of the terms 'far left' and 'far right', 
and those terms were quite easy to understand because I could simply picture
them on a one-dimensional number line. But now, the lunacy that is the keyboard
warrior introduces a new term that throws people such as me completely off
balance. Far center, he says?!?! There is no far center, there is only the
center that defines what is extreme and what is close to the center. We are the
center, Chief Admiral. It is up to us to fully take back our authority to bring
order and stability to the system.

Please tell me that you do not have any hesitations on dealing with the
keyboard warrior and his sympathizers by any means necessary, like how that 
one philosopher many centuries back wrote. You seem to have a soft spot. Is 
it Marie that makes you restrain yourself so that you follow all the rules 
like a good and obedient boy waiting for his supper, cooked by Marie? Do not
fool yourself into thinking that I do not know about your feelings for Marie, 
Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez. You should hate women such as her,
if I do say so myself, because back when you two were young and innocent in
school, the things that you wanted to happen should have happened. But now
you are old, and she is old, and there can be nothing but adultery between
you two in these present days.

The keyboard warrior is amassing many supporters, Chief, and our numerical 
superiority is quickly dwindling against these cyber-hordes and digital 
barbarian types. This is a critical time for us to regroup and preserve our
morale. We have all the cyber technology necessary to do what is unarguably
right, defeating the keyboard warrior and all of his sympathizers. Perhaps
the reason why we have been under-performing so much is entirely because of
your actions and sympathies. Perhaps Marie has to go... 

Some words of wisdom, Chief Admiral. This is no time to ponder, question, and
accept things.

Sincerely, 

The Lord Commodore Marshall"

## Chief Admiral is deeply offended by his treatment and consorts with one of his lovers

From: Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez   
To: Olivia-Katerina de la Hernandez, a lover of the Chief Admiral

"It is with a heavy heart that I am forced to write to you to express my love
for you as well as to give you insight into my present sufferings, 
Olivia-Katerina. I was recently chastised to a great extent by my superior,
you know who, the Lord Commodore Marshall. The man had the audacity to 
question my loyalties and effectiveness when it is he that is the commander
in the charge of the uncountable cyber-troops that lost their cyber-lives
against the keyboard warrior. During those moments of weakness, when leaders
such as I, in our helplessness to help our own, decided to share the pain by
participating in collective mourning, the Lord Commodore decided it was his
duty to come forward to chastise me. 

My feelings and ego are hurt. For him to question my love and loyalty, when
I am more loving, more loyal, and better than him across the performance metrics, 
demonstrates a psychopathic man intent to remain in power at anyone's expense, 
even his own allies. All the effort that I expended, a clear demonstration of 
my dedication, is completely ignored. How could someone whose prime strategy is 
to divide and divide, even having the audacity to tell me that the technique is 
the greatest goal, be entirely trusted? One of the first thoughts I have, quite 
frankly, when I hear those words of division from him, is that maybe I am the 
one that is next. Maybe I somehow stumble upon the bad luck that divides me 
from my loved ones, especially you, my Olivia, oh how beautiful you were when 
I first met you and how you retain your beauty through these harsh times. 

I am starting to believe that there may be a crossroads approaching that will
pit me against both the keyboard warrior and the Lord Commodore Marshall. Boy,
do I hope history does not repeat itself, seeing as how every time a triangle
gets mentioned, such as the First Triumvirate, something goes terribly wrong.
I am a simple person with only a few peculiarities. One of those peculiarities
that I am quite fond of is scale. Scale is the only way towards greatness, and 
I believe in this idea so much that I approach life with an open mind and a 
good heart, willing to incorporate anyone from any background of life if only 
they were to return me the same favor by having minds equally as open and 
hearts as big. This principle of mine is being greatly tested as my forces 
continue to dwindle, either being digitally defeated or defecting over to the
keyboard warrior.

I feel as if I cannot be entirely trusted, which ruins my natural benevolent
disposition. My hand is forced, and my martial authority is being diverted
towards fighting both real and imaginary enemies not for the sake of the
collective. Instead, it is for the sake of one man only, the Lord Commodore 
Marshall. I am making more enemies with each passing day, because the 
keyboard warrior's forces have been actively recruiting from and spying on our 
forces. At first, I was baffled by my comrades' suspicions that were provoked by 
the Lord Commodore Marshall. I was in a state of deep doubtfulness, but when I
finally crawled out of that mental hell hole, I found the strength and direction 
to redirect those questions imposed upon me to the source of those questions, 
the Lord Commodore Marshall. 

The Lord Commodore Marshall has a cold Northern style of doing things, a clear 
juxtaposition to my natural warmth and forthrightness. I am a man of passion. 
I fight with my heart, and I am driven by all that I love to continue fighting 
on, even when the fighting gets rough. Even when I am unappreciated, I go the 
extra mile. However, Olivia, the sheer amount of authentic love I have given
you is a clear difference from the love that I have wasted in my efforts against
the keyboard warrior. My efforts have been thwarted, and it is not because I am 
not as powerful as the keyboard warrior. On the contrary, I believe my failures 
have been due to politics. 

On the matters of my financials, I am anticipating a financial ruin of some kind.
The secret internet business I have with the keyboard warrior is done for! 
Completely ruined now because all of the cyber fighting has caused revenue 
and workforce to decline alongside the meteoric rise of politics! I hate 
politics! I was taught to never get political, ever. And now my hand is 
forced, and I am supposed to be an active participant in it, allowing hatred 
and division to foster in my otherwise benevolent heart. If it was not for this
cyber war that I am forced to participate in by none other than the Lord
Commodore Marshall, you and I could be happily spending our days on a sunny
beach, celebrating the numbers in my bank account, your money, due in great 
part to my joint partnership with the keyboard warrior in his cyber business.

And that is not all, Olivia! My discipline in the art, craft, and science of 
militarism has been put into question. I am being embarassed and humiliated 
by my subordinates because they believe that I have passed my prime, and I 
am no longer the man that deserves this great title of Chief Admiral. I am,
in their eyes, a symbol of the decay of collective mismanagement, in the 
position that is an officious decoration. I tried to hold onto basic principles
such as favoring classical cyber technology over newer versions that I 
believe have not been thoroughly tried and tested yet. But yet, I feel so 
alone in this place where those that are supposed to unquestionably be my
friends think of me as an inside joke.

Our cyber technology has proven to be more of a hassle than it is worth, and
it is worth billions, according to the market! Billions! The cyber-soldiers
under my command do not know how to effectively use any of it. Recently, an
entire cyber battalion of mine perished in a head-on confrontation with a
cyber-horde sent by the keyboard warrior. The cyber-horde used a diverse array
of cyber weapons, inducing panic and disarray into the cyber battalion's
formation. The cyber battalion's main strength, its uniformity, quickly 
crumbled when they were rushed by the cyber-horde's cyber-cavalry. In their
moments of weakness, they were systematically disarmed and eliminated, and
perished so unexpectedly that when I received the news, I honestly believed 
that it was disinformation from a propagandist under the keyboard warrior.

I am exhausted from worrying, and when I try to rest, it is already time for 
me to wake up and train the cyber-troops, some of the most ragtag and 
undisciplined people you will meet. They think of nothing besides from things 
that are besides the point. I do not want to criticize my friends, honestly, 
but my shame in doing so is balanced by my urge to be completely honest to at 
least one other person! And that is you, my Olivia, my love! On another one of
my recent sleepless nights, I write these words to you, and afterwards, I will
lay in bed and think of you until the next day. May there be a day in the near
future when I can just disown everything I have, abandon all of my fellow fighters,
and escape with you to some remote land to live out the rest of my life in peace
and paradise without any of these terrible things going on in my life, especially
politics!

Sincerely,

Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez"

## The Lord Commodore receives a message offering great help

From: Executive Fritzjeral the Elizabethean   
To: The Lord Commodore Marshall

"We have met before, my lord, but you the important person that you are, have 
many duties and responsibilities that go over the memory of casual people you 
have met. Allow me to formally introduce myself, my lord. I am Executive
Fritzjeral of the Elizabethean Group, or Elizabethean for short. I have watched
your fight against the menace that is the keyboard warrior escalate from simple
cyber surveillance to perhaps one of the most brutal modern conflicts by the use 
of cyber technology. I am a woman of a peaceful disposition. I have a daily 
routine, I do my chores, and I am a keen and understanding listener of things
right or wrong, despite my strong moral compass and the complexity of my 
character's strength. I like to stay neutral on most things because I have read
and heard about the endgame of many serious feuds. 

But on this matter that you have with the keyboard warrior, you do certainly 
need some help, my lord. Lord Commodore Marshall, I can help you produce all that 
you need in this conflict with the keyboard warrior. Do not be so prideful as to
deny me entrance into your forces out of your own personal fears and insecurities.
I do not want to usurp you, my lord, and that is no question. But given the
trajectory of your forces' performance, there is definitely a begging for the
question of where your fate lies if you lose to this keyboard warrior. I do not
want to pressure you into accepting my offer, but another fact that I would like
to point out for your own good is your high status, which will not do you any
favors if the possibility of the keyboard warrior's unanimous victory is
actualized. He will have you gone in the worst way, and I do not mean it as you
having the freedom to go live life elsewhere on this planet. 

It is no longer a secret that your forces are dwindling, my lord. You initiated
a serious cyber conflict with the keyboard warrior using just one of your highly
specialized cyber units, of about 60 troops. Then when the keyboard warrior's
support base suddenly exploded in growth, as if overnight, and his offensive 
and defensive cyber networks matched a large fraction of your own forces, you had
to dedicate entire cyber battalions towards making your nemesis meet his demise.
And as his power expanded into something so amazingly effective even though many
of his forces lacked the formal training and the titles, your forces began a 
clear record of defeat after defeat. The fates of your cyber-troops that are no 
longer with us are either with the keyboard warrior due to their defection or
they are long gone from this world, felled by the keyboard warrior's cyber power.
Things are starting to look grim, my lord, and I saw the stress and angst on your
face the last time I saw your physical presence. I will not go on to describing 
you from my perspective. I am aware of the demoralizing effect of unnecessary
judgment. 

Do not continue your urgent rush to victory, although you may be strong and 
capable of defeating the keyboard warrior in a cyber-duel. The conflict has become 
large scale, and the keyboard warrior and you may never physically meet for cyber 
combat. Your cyber and physical supplies are running low, and you have failed in
one of your great objectives set out from the beginning, to thwart the 
keyboard warrior's construction and use of the bridge connecting the cyber and
physical worlds. I want to aid you in these critical times when you can still 
turn the tide your way for a victory that is not so costly and crippling. I am 
offering to produce cyber technology for you of a high-quality standard grade.
Your forces have been using some of the most expensive cyber equipment at a 
subpar level. The user interface for that same equipment is outdated, and requires 
at least a full year of training to be utilized to its potential. I, being of the 
Elizabethean Group, own factories that can mass-produce cyber technology that 
builds up on what your cyber forces already have. And my products allow for them
to coordinate with each other better and to be more efficient in the use of their
tools. I would like to add, I am the heiress to the intelligent CAT-CHIP 
manufacturing machine, an assortment of manufacturing robots that can assemble 
hardware chips that are at the cutting edge of cyber offense and defense. Please, 
do not think lightly of my offer to you. Your troops, due to their ignorance of 
the powerful technology at their disposal, are forced to fight a conflict with 
cyber tools of a quality many decades back. 

I understand if you do not want to continue this conversation over cyberspace.
You can easily look up the address to my humble and lovely abode. Please, come
on by at any time and any day, and we can thoroughly communicate to each other
however way you prefer so that my resources and skills become specially geared
to benefit you on your noble path to victory against the keyboard warrior.

Sincerely, 

Executive Fritzjeral the Elizabethean"

# Part XXVIII 
## The Lord Commodore responds to the Elizabethean

From: The Lord Commodore Marshall   
To: Executive Fritzjeral the Elizabethean

"Why, of course I remember you, Fritzjeral! I still fondly recall my first 
encounter with you at the dinner party used to fundraise that one person who
had a brilliant business idea to sell to the military industrial complex. I
do not remember that person because their idea was boring and too technical. 
You know how those scientist and intellectual types are, I am sure, with their
lofty notions that do not go anywhere, only seeking to disrupt and denounce the
socio-economic order that already exists, and the only way for them to bring their
ideas into reality is to basically defraud the generosity of hierarchs such as I,
the Lord Commodore Marshall. However, despite my differences with some of those
scientist and intellectual types, I can tell you that they are much more gentle
and honest about what they believe in and what they like to work in than some of
these other folks that also want to join the hotshot business class. I am talking
about those gambler and frontman types, the ones that are always claiming to 
represent the downtrodden and destitute, and the same ones that say that they are
humble and wise and whatever but then also say that they started from the bottom
and now they are kings. Kings, they say. Oh, it is whatever, Fritzjeral! I guess 
I went on a little tirade there telling you about some of the characters that I 
have met in the business world. 

I will tell you why I fondly remember you, out of all the characters that I met
since I am in this prestigious position that I am in. It is because of your 
handshake, since when I shook your hand, it was by far the softest hand I have
ever shaken but it was no hand of a child. Instead, it was the hand of a 
gentlewoman that had the privilege to never have had to do manual labor or even
to slap children around to put them in their place. By process of elimination 
then, I can only assume that whatever work you have done with your hands, 
Executive, is unquestionably benevolent and even angelic, a stark contrast with 
those that have had to do dirty work to get by in this world. And that is why I 
trust you when you say that you are a woman of peace. I admit that I feel very 
lucky to have had the fortune of your offering of help.

Well, I think I have written enough as to formally re-introduce myself to you,
Executive Fritzjeral. Now, I will offer you an account on my personal situation 
on dealing with the keyboard warrior. The keyboard warrior was flagged by
our cyber system a long time ago, more than a decade, as a potential cyber threat.
At that point in time, I was busy having to deal with more notorious people, so
I paid him no attention. I thought that he would have straightened himself out 
into a professional role by this time. And by professional role, I mean a job 
position that is not the rebel leader of a cyber-militaristic force against the 
official military forces, where I have been tasked with leading all operations 
against him. Anyhow, it was about two years ago when official military forces 
started conducting cyber-defensive offenses to deter people such as him from 
moving on without having to answer for their deplorable cyber acts. I admit, many 
of the operatives did not follow all their own rules in reinforcing the 
socio-political order. But we had very little choice, Executive. There were too
many offenses being taken by the good and the bad alike that official forces had
to basically play the frustrating game of whack-a-mole. It was during this time,
two years ago, that conventional electronic devices became fully connected to the 
AI Hivemind. This absolute connection was further enabled by the secret invention
of COMPQ5, the amazing nanotechnology that acts as an invisible medium of 
computation, or should I say, anti-computation against its targets. With the
invention of COMPQ5, the bridge connecting the cyber and physical worlds was
enabled. But the powers that be knew that such capabilities, without mass
awareness could lead to severe abuse. So COMPQ5 was kept as a novel underground
technology, used only by the privileged during the most dire of times. 

The keyboard warrior is special because he was able to survive our state-sponsored
cyber assaults against him. Even some mobs that were compensated handsomely with 
gold became involved in undermining and persecuting him. I set up a special 
cyber-unit dedicated to tormenting the man using such techniques as putting him 
into a self-destructive digital maze of his own making, continual exfiltration of 
his personal life's information, as well as lawfare and economic warfare by
blacklisting him so that he could never find the peace of a job that pays
him well enough for any of the basic human necessities. But throughout my campaign
against him, I realized that the more techniques I employed against him, the less
effective those techniques became. While I was commanding my forces to 
metaphorically egg the guy into submission and humiliation, I inadvertently 
promoted a great moral doubt amongst them. I believe it is this spiritual decay 
on the part of my forces that led them astray to focus on other issues, perhaps 
their own personal problems, instead of directly dealing with the keyboard 
warrior to ensure his very own demise. I lost many fine soldiers, Executive, the
greatest one of them all being Captain Alleudegren, a true star and model for my
forces. But it was his failures, as a leader to deliver on the result of the 
absolute defeat of the keyboard warrior, that forced my hand to punish him so that
I can maintain control and order over my forces. Captain Alleudegren is now in
a physical cyber-mind prison, where his intellectual and physical prowess is 
being used to train our forces' artificial intelligence systems. Although he is
a dear friend of mine, I do believe that his present contributions to artificial
intelligence will enable me to be in command of a thousand, perhaps even a 
million, cyber-military units on par with the captain's intellectual and physical
capabilities. Admittedly, I would personally hate to be in his position because
it is an exemplar of exploitation, but you can understand that based on the
forecasted statistics, the pain and suffering of a few are well worth the victory
and domination of many.

You understand the grave threat that the keyboard warrior poses now, Executive.
Through my forces' expansion and adoption of new cyber-military grade technology,
our operations that continue to backfire against the keyboard warrior, in turn,
enabled him to adapt his techniques to our power. He even had the initiative to
scavenge every cyber battlefield that he won for our technology, which his forces
then reverse-engineered, modified, and incorporated into their own cyber-arsenal.
You are offering your help at the right time, my Elizabethean. My forces have
been running low on supplies, especially cyber-weaponry. I would like you to
immediately start production of the 1.1TR chips at a rate of 2 trillion per month.
I did the mathematics in this ongoing cyber war with the keyboard warrior. My forces
are expected to go through about 1.8 trillion of the 1.1TR chips, the latest 
cutting-edge chip used for cyber-physical warfare brought to the commercial
space due to my forces' demands. By producing 2 trillion of these chips a month,
Executive, you can ensure that my forces do not become deprived of the best
cyber-weaponry that our age has to offer. 

That is all that I ask of you, Executive, and nothing more. I do not want to 
burden you with any details of my forces' cyber war with the keyboard warrior. 
I effectively put you on a censorship list so that you cannot access any of the 
footage being captured. You, just as anyone else, are under the principle of 
need-to-know. Besides, you are a gentlewoman of peace, and you need not corrupt
your soul by consuming such media. And do not think that you are promoting
bloodshed either, my Elizabethean. If a person is their actions, then to 
clarify, the person is their direct actions based on the simple premise that
a person is not culpable for evil that they themselves do not defeat. Oh, 
but there is one other thing I ask of you. It is about the Chief Admiral 
Roumannios de la Cruziyez, who I believe has secretly defected over to the 
keyboard warrior or is at least contemplating to break off some members of my 
forces and abandon the war in the keyboard warrior's favor. If he contacts 
you with anything, anything at all, please inform me on all the details, what 
he says, who he is with, where he is, and so on.

Sincerely, 

The Lord Commodore Marshall"

# Part XXIX 
## Aunt Marie gives Janice secrets about the present and warnings about the future

From: Marie, aunt of the keyboard warrior   
To: Janice, wife of the keyboard warrior

"You must pity me, Janice, for this message of mine will greatly upset you. It
appears that through our family business ordeal with Gregoyonuger, many details
have been omitted from discussion. But now, this business that your husband serves
as an executive in is silently crumbling like a house of cards. You are probably
wondering why you were not informed of these issues already, given the great
influence that the business claims to possess. The answer is as simple as knowing
the importance of maintaining secrecy over our vulnerabilities, Janice. The press
dare not talk about these business issues that are accumulating into greater 
discontent over time. Any communication by anyone regarding our business issues 
will most definitely implicate them more than it does the keyboard warrior and
Gregoyonuger, all else being equal. 

The big takeaway is that the business is facing insolvency. The theories and
reasons behind why are plenty, but I personally would like to say that it is due
to no deliberate or accidental errors on the part of the keyboard warrior or
Gregoyonuger. Instead, it is due to the reactive nature of the changes happening
to this society we live in. As you very well know, Janice, business is hard to
build up, and the challenge of growing a business is compounded by maintaining
the business's competitive livelihood. A lot of organizations are in a head-on
competition with our business, Janice, and I am afraid that the board of 
executives under Gregoyonuger have already quietly decided to dissolve the 
organization. This is my best guess because I know of quite a few people there 
that have been sneaking around, withdrawing funds from the company when doing so 
is clearly against the rules and regulations. I do not want to tell you about any 
more specifics. Doing so only spells more trouble in the form of unnecessary 
stress for you, Janice, especially since you are already married to the brilliant 
man that is the keyboard warrior. And so, your goal first and foremost should be 
to forge and maintain a healthy and fair relationship with him.

This is a warning to you about the inevitable problems of the internet business
between the keyboard warrior and Gregoyonuger. People such as I must practice 
the strategy of restraint from being so open about these problems, because 
it would make us prey. Revealing such things ruin the originally benevolent
judgments from the commoners that would then motivate them to take action 
against us to further tarnish our high image. I apologize if you are taken aback 
by this news I am providing you, and it is okay for you to feel personally 
affronted by these revelations. But please, do not think of me as the bearer of 
bad news. I am only revealing to you about the many things to come because of 
these conditions. I am sorry, but in my personal objective to think,act, and most 
importantly, appear as a selfless woman, albeit one of high society and the wealth 
to prove it, I have neglected some basic tenets of common courtesy. Common 
courtesy says that I should not have kept some problems a secret, and that my 
words and actions do not merely serve as a performative defense against 
adversaries potential or apparent. What I am admitting is that my role in society 
requires a kind of selfishness that extends beyond ethno-cultural decorum, Janice. 
I am not the only one that is selfish here, Janice. Your husband as well as 
Gregoyonuger also took up the privilege of omitting vital information on the 
well-being of the business from you. I am sure you have heard of the term
'noble lie', darling, although you originally came from a lower middle-class
standing. The 'noble lie' dictates that there is a need to maintain order through 
the most noblest form of dishonesty. I am afraid that every person has their
limits on achieving selflessness. Even you, Janice, are somewhat selfish because
you chose to marry my nephew, the keyboard warrior, knowing full well that he 
is related to members of high society such as me. Otherwise, you would have
married that guy living across the street from you, who you told my nephew is
so much more heroic than him because the guy is the strong and silent type.

It won't be long now, Janice, at most four months, before the business goes 
completely down under. And then the press will start publishing their yellow
articles, what those people always do to take in small fractions of what people
such as us rightfully own and control. One of the great travesties of our modern
age, dear, is that our technological and intellectual progress cannot negate
the storytelling and myth-crafting by people from various backgrounds, noble,
ignoble, political operatives, foreign agents, and the law and the outlaws alike.
You should be prepared for some unwanted attention, Janice. There will be those
people prowling and snooping around, collecting all kinds of information on you.
Try to not feed those people, because what goods that you do not offer them, they
will try to spin it so that their listeners and followers compensate them 
with gold and power. 

In the meantime as well as for the foreseeable future, you should be wise to
maintain steady eyes on your husband, the keyboard warrior. I do not want to
go out on a limb for writing this to you, but I believe that he may have
knowledge or be directly involved in what some people have been whispering is a
secret cyber war, or a shadow cyber war. I do not know the exact terminology
these strange consultants and experts have been using, but what socio-economic
turmoils that you are able to see before your very eyes, Janice, may simply be
the most benevolent of symptoms from the great turmoil and suffering going on
in the underground. I would hate to discover on one of these days that the
keyboard warrior is a willing participant, perhaps even a leader, in these 
ominous cyber battles taking place that effectively push our democracy and 
republic into the shade of social disorder and poverty. You, being the keyboard
warrior's wife, are best poised to discover the specifics of what he has been
doing when he is not managing business, since the business is obviously going
under. I will tell you that the keyboard warrior is one of the members of the
business that mysteriously withdrew a large sum of funds. What do you think he
would need that much raw capital for? Could it be that your husband, the keyboard
warrior, is planning to use that capital to fund cyber rebels and fuel ongoing
shadow wars that use cyber technology because cyber technology is the most 
cutting-edge way to fight nowadays? Thankfully not, Janice. I feel very stressed
and anxious having to write to you about my suspicions about your husband. I would
rather watch drama, eat exotic foods, and spend some time outdoors instead of 
having to think about the monstrosities possibly connected to me. This problem
with the shadow cyber-wars that are slowly reaching members of high society such
as me serves me no benefits whatsoever, just to show you how fair life is 
between the various strata of human society. I am giving you the responsibility of
keeping an eye on your husband, and you might have to rein him in by any means
necessary.

Sincerely,     
Aunt Marie"

# Part XXX
## The Lord Commodore communicates some critical top-secret information to his new 2nd-in-command

From: The Lord Commodore Marshall   
To: Cyber Alleudegren #1

"It is I, the Lord Commodore Marshall. There are many ongoing events that 
require my detailed explaining to you and you only, since you have quite 
literally arisen from the inferno and dust to reach the great achievement
of your present station as my second-in-command. Your father, Captain Alleudegren,
is very proud and honored that you have taken up the mantle to serve in my
official military forces, as a testament to your allegiance that is required of
someone with your background. The captain is now living in exile, for his own
good, although I strongly urge you not to give too many thoughts about him. You
and he will probably never meet face to face because all of your working years
are to be dedicated to upholding our incredible nation's security and prestige.
You are free to think and ponder on your ancestry, Cyber Alleudegren #1, but 
I hope that you will not drive yourself into existential despair. You must
recognize that you are not a human, by definition. You were brought into this
world through the intellect and perfectionism of the best of engineers and 
scientists as well as the laboring and suffering of your father that was used 
to train your thinking and actions into an efficient cybernetic form, free from
some of the trappings of moral restraint that is a staple of the human psyche.
It is not about your status amongst other beings, but your role, Cyber Alleudegren
#1. You have reached a great pinnacle in the spectrum of successes possible for 
humans and non-humans alike, and should always look and think forward. 

I am finished discussing some of the fine details about your background, and now
I can spell out our next biggest objective. The cyber-reconnaissance operation
that you headed last week has yielded some much needed insight into the logistics
of the keyboard warrior's forces. Your operation did more than simply monitor 
the activities and movements of the enemy. It also conducted intensive analysis
of their battle techniques and supply chains. Because of this operation, we know
which regions of the world have been mass-producing cyber-weaponry for the 
scoundrel keyboard warrior and his cyber-military. I, for the life of me, do not
understand how anyone could possibly do business with such a hatemonger, 
perfecting his prototypal ideas into cyber-military grade that our official 
military forces have to go up against. We are to use the intelligence gathered
from this cyber-reconnaissance operation to launch a multi-front attack that 
flips the strengths of diversity and unpredictability of the keyboard warrior's 
forces against him. We will rely on the network-attack strategy that you 
personally came up with to enmesh his forces into a disorganization that really 
bites them into paralysis, and in those ripe moments of their weakness, we will 
execute the experimental swarming technique that our forces have been training in. 
A most ironic finding about this swarming technique we are to use is that it is 
quite inspired by the fighting strategy of the keyboard warrior, but it has been 
modified to be much more efficient and intended to counter the enemy's swarming. 
This is due in large part to our military forces' rapid mechanization from 
predominantly human operators of cyber-technology to cyber-technology that can 
regulate and act by its own accord that is usually always correct by human 
standards. You can thank the supply chain under my command, I the Lord Commodore 
Marshall, for this wise and swift improvement. 

The multiple fronts of relevant focus, Cyber Alleudegren #1, are the family 
members of the keyboard warrior, specifically his wife and aunt, the keyboard 
warrior's trading partners, and a select few of his cyber-encampments. This 
offensive should deal a crippling blow to the keyboard warrior's capabilities if 
not damage his forces' morale. You and I will have a face-to-face conversation on 
these fronts sometime later this week, so that our communications do not risk 
interception. In the meantime, I would like you to look into the White Tiger's
Son manufacturing facility, where many of us believe is responsible for 
transporting precursor equipment for final assembly of the keyboard warrior's
cyber-weaponry. The facility is owned by the Zheng Tao Kahnlieng Klan, and it has
served as a very important commercial center of cutting-edge research and
development for well over a half of a century. I do have fears that our strategy 
may not work out so well, my friend. It is due to no one other than the Chief 
Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez. I suspected the man to have been secretly 
collaborating with the keyboard warrior about half a year ago, but I did not have 
the time or the effort to engage in any deep investigation into the question. 
However, as luck and justice united may have it, one of my cyber-analysts 
uncovered some bleak facts. Through the extensive metadata your cyber-
reconnaissance produced, the Chief Admiral Roumannios has most definitely 
turned against me. I stand corrected. It is not just me that he has betrayed. But 
rather, it is our entire official military forces, and that necessarily makes him 
a traitor to our nation. Now, I do not want you to think that this discovery that 
is most definitely not concocted by me for my own selfish gains to constitute an 
illegitimate power grab. Please heed my words, Cyber Alleudegren #1, that our odds 
of success against the keyboard warrior are still slim. There are issues with our 
supply chain's production of cyber-military units that impede on it meeting its 
monthly goals. Resources are expensive, and we do not have any more than two 
chances to deal the forces of the keyboard warrior a blow damaging enough as 
to mute them into disability and death if not the shame of silence. The 
reasoning goes, that it is fundamental that we maintain unitary integrity amongst 
our forces by offering them directions to victory that do not coincide with their 
possible defection or abandonment of their posts. We are in a serious predicament, 
and we cannot entertain notions by our own forces about what life could be if 
there was peace and harmony when the evidence is as clear as the most beautiful 
woman in the world on who initiated great threats to our democracy and republic 
and who continues to do so. The answer is the keyboard warrior. And now the Chief 
Admiral has decided to work against us, in the keyboard warrior's favor by the 
process of elimination.

It is imperative that we first deal with the Chief Admiral. I am tired of having
to expend effort to try to fix the man's head straight. He clearly sees no
better choice than to back the keyboard warrior. You should have read the 
decrypted message he sent to one of his many lovers, as if the man can really
love anything other than what things he can touch and smell. He thinks that I am a
divisive force because I believe in quelling doubt and discontent through verbal
if not physical confrontation. I am of the school where if there are secrets to
be kept, there are no things to be mentioned about them, and they should never
lead to conspiracy that undermines the wholeness of our official military
forces. However, with the Chief Admiral, there always seems to be secrets that
are shared. And when secrets are shared but they are still called secrets, then
some people are to be excluded, and other people, perhaps the same ones that are
excluded, are to immensely lose. But he claims to believe in scale and unity, 
and in his message to one of his lovers, thinks that I am a cold and callous
leader versed in what he says is the Northern style of leadership. That does not
sound very harmonious from my perspective. Wouldn't you agree, Cyber Alleudegren
#1? I do not understand how people such as him can reach those thoughts without
coming up with valid lines of reasoning beforehand, but the man is probably a 
shameless person underneath. Shamelessness is an unfortunate aspect of the 
human psyche. But the capability of many humans to act and drive further without 
the chains of shame is then restricted by their own fears and equally as
important, the resources that they have at their disposal since quarreling and
bickering over privileges and ownership is a cumbersome aspect of human 
existence, even when there are entire doctrines dedicated to eliminating the 
idea of ownership and privilege. Look, Cyber Alleudegren #1. I do not really
give a care about what the Chief Admiral does in his personal life. But his
influence as a defector ripples out into our forces, casting fears of possible
betrayals left and right. The Chief Admiral is an emotive person. He definitely
has his skills and uses, but I recognized a long time ago that we would 
eventually reach this impasse. He is the type to act very unreasonably, and he
can be as cruel as me in many ways. But I noticed that every time I tried to 
correct his mistakes, he puts up an emotive defense that draws the sympathies
of his fellow emotive thinkers, as if I said outright expletives to him in any
serious fashion. Maybe it is because I talk down to him, but it is simply 
because that is my role and responsibility as the Lord Commodore Marshall. 

It is because he thinks he is better than me. He also thinks that I think 
I am better than him. I surely cannot blame him for his antagonism against me. 
But now I have the evidence to settle the score with the man for good, outside
of the realm of debate that needs to stay civilized in what is such an 
artificially democratic atmosphere. A permanent memorial to the man that was once 
the Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez, to be permanently recorded in 
our history books as a traitor to our democracy and republic that is our state. 
That will be our first task, Cyber Alleudegren #1, before we move on to our 
strategy against the keyboard warrior. 

Sincerely,   
The Lord Commodore Marshall"

## Gregoyonuger says his farewell with plans to leave the country

From: Gregoyonuger   
To: The Keyboard Warrior and Marie

"I think it is a good time for me to start on my exit from these business 
arrangements. Our lawyers have been busy working on the bankruptcy paperwork, 
as well as dealing with the swarms of clientele and business partners. I see 
that, through these circumstances, my role as a business associate is not only
looking dubious, but outright unnecessary. I am not fretting though because I
have enough capital to go live life somewhere else. That is right, I am relocating
back to my homeland, after spending countless hours pondering over what to do.

Here is my thinking. I no longer feel as though I am an active force in what I
would like to do. To compound on these troubles as well as the interest rates
that I am being further drowned in, I have been having family issues. Money is
tight, and the insecurities by those that expect from those that provide have 
been driving me mad. Completely bonkers. I am also thinking about getting a 
divorce, but that is a separate issue.

Now, I do not want you two to think that I am forsaking your interests. I tried
to initiate conversation a few days ago, and there were little words spoken. I 
felt as though I was a very awkward and unwanted presence in the room. If there
are no further words to be exchanged, because I believe I have none, then you
two can wholeheartedly expect such a decision by me. I hope business was as fun
for me as it was for you, since we all agreed from the start what roles each of 
us would play. Please do not expend any more stress or sorrows for it, since 
the nature of our business requires the momentum and position that no one man
or even one entire organization can architect on its own. We made money, we lost
money, and could not find a way to obtain more money to cover our losses and
keep on going. And every one of us needs to willingly accept those facts for 
sanity.

That is enough business talk, I believe. I would like to share some of my 
observations with you two on what I am witnessing in this city. It looks as 
though many businesses have been closing and getting boarded up. I have been
seeing more homeless people this past half year on the streets. And I believe,
based on some of the things I have been able to deduce, that some people may
not like me. Perhaps it is because of my position as a businessperson.
I am not a native citizen of this country, and seeing these circumstances make
me feel as though I am becoming a drain on everyone else. Granted, my social
circle has always been somewhat small even though I put up a facade of the 
outgoing player. These were some of the factors that finalized my decision to
relocate back home, where financial conditions sound as though they are likewise
as dire, but at least I have a base of operations back there, in my home sweet
home country.

I left a dossier of information and links on each of your desks. Farewell, at 
least for now. If you ever find some other lucrative hub where calculated
investments will handsomely pay off for every person's betterment, then please
do reach out again. But for the foreseeable future, think of me as gone. 

Sincerely,

## A doctor sends a message to the Chief Admiral after an incident occurred

From: Aaliyah de la Abadi, a lover of the Chief Admiral   
To: Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez

"Stay strong, Chief Admiral! I am swiftly coming to you after recently received
word of the terrible event that beset upon you, from a Trudy Truwelleanas! My,
and poor Miss Olivia-Katerina de la Hernandez tragically passed shortly after this
event, is what I have been told. I do not know how else to express my deep and
genuine sentiments for your predicament, Roumannios. Even if you have been 
severely disfigured by this completely unnecessary cyber-attack from an assailant
unknown to most people, including me, I would still equally go out of my way to
love you all the same. 

You must rest up and heal in this world of modern medicine, where diseases and 
afflictions that bear grave historical outlooks, can be effectively reversed.
Miracles do happen to those that believe and also are conveniently near where the 
cures and doctors are. And I believe you to be one of the lucky ones, even after 
this terrible incident, which I am sure that you will rebound with a completely 
justified vengeance against the ones that staged this cyber-attack against you. 
I never knew that there was such darkness in this world, since I devoted much of
my life to modern and futuristic medicine, and my career efforts are entirely 
confined to the role of a healer, a constructive person. I guess that in my 
steeped concentration to become an expert in the field that has made remarkable 
advances from the applications of cyber-technology, I turned a blind eye to the 
other edge of the sword, the sharper and lethal side that is cyber-technology in 
militaristic form. I never could have imagined that cyber-attacks have evolved
to carry such lethal force to its targets, but as I have said before, I am no 
expert in the range of effects that cyber-technology carry in these modern days.

I am indeed sorry for having the knowledge of the dire health that has befallen 
you but also the ignorance of the suffering you have experienced from your own
perspective, although I truly hold no ill intentions having admitted to you my
ignorance. I have the capabilities to help you on your guaranteed path to 
recovery, in which you will be restored to your previous physical and mental 
greatness if not more, because I analyzed the reports given to me by the 
central hospital through their cyber-informatic channels. While I am swiftly
being transported to your location that you have kept secret from many due to
your wolvish aggressors somewhere hot on your trail, I would like you to remain
calm and to keep on resting. Furthermore, you need to forget all the negative 
thoughts from the past and even the moments of your life you spent with 
Olivia-Katerina de la Hernandez, for she is dead now, gone in this world with 
such a selectively malicious side in an era that promised the greatest wonders
and happiness from cyber-technology. Yes, life is unfair but you still have a
future. Perhaps your future will not be as bright as others due to what 
things you tell yourself you must do. I believe you are telling yourself that 
you must fight. And fight you will after you make a swift recovery that serves
as one of the most powerful motivators, the comeback that so surprises your
enemies that they will at least mentally tremble upon receiving word or sight
of you as the survivor. 

And then, the glory of the fight can come first. Then it will be your moment to
seize what you have always believed you deserve but did not step up to take for
yourself due to your restraint from a disciplined morality. Do not be so foolish 
as to obsess over the semantics of your setbacks when it is still your vision 
and your world in this near future that if heaven has its will, just and right, 
grants you triumphant victories that effectively erase all the losses during your 
journey, of many fights and changes of heart in who you are to fight with and what 
to fight for. It is okay to make changes and take different stands. I, personally,
wanted to be an actress when I was younger, but quickly switched over to the 
medical field once I realized how slim my odds were as a woman that is not slim
enough for the magazines.

I am one that understands many things in dichotomies, especially life and death 
due to my extensive experience in medicine. But in your case, I quickly remind
myself that there are many things in this world that can be understood in 
dichotomies. Alas, it is these dichotomies that I will gladly share with you in 
order to grant you my blessings and good luck for your troubles past, present,
and future. I will gladly sacrifice any unspecificed amount of time for you
so that you will achieve a meaningful and long-lasting inner peace for the many 
battles you are to take up in the near future for your own causes and motives.

Sincerely,

Aaliyah de la Abadi"

## Chief Admiral makes a wholehearted announcement to his base of support

From: Chief Admiral Roumannios de la Cruziyez   
To: His Followers and Sympathizers

"If it was not for the several cyber-calendars that were next to me during my
time of recovery, I would be lost for time as of now. But I am not, fully
recovered and aware of the six months that passed since the devastating 
cyber-attack that did more than try to ruin me. It is this same cyber attack that
took the love of my life from this world. May Olivia-Katerina's beauty and 
majesty as a human being be forever memorialized and shown its due respect.
As for me, my full physical recovery has most definitely not come at the expense
of modern medicine alone for I recover from my injuries with a soul twisted 
and split by the human loss of what I have held dear. But I know not to look
back on these setbacks with a sour attitude and a wretched heart.

I had many doubts about my beliefs and who my true friends were before this
event. I went about life in a dream-like and bubbly state that was neither 
the life of the dream or the hells of nightmares. I was, in actuality, trapped
in a trance that I could not break out of, a subjectivity that I did not enjoy.
The torment of my life experience before my near-death experience miraculously
went away after the event, a miracle that gave me a sense of spirituality on
how to view things in more concrete and precise terms. These changes are about
as profound as the unbelievable changes in modern medicine that enabled my
full recovery from a horridly broken pseudo-survivor to someone as physically
great as before and superior in mentality. A changed mind makes a changed man
is the moral of this story, because I sincerely can never use the word `moral`
in the same sentence as those that staged the cyber-attack against me. 

Back in the days when I was a loyal soldier of the Lord Commodore Marshall, I 
admit that I participated in things that go against the idea of unity, something
that greatly upsets me even though I have never witnessed absolute unity before 
but can only imagine a world of great unity and connectiveness, the only way for
an everlasting harmony. And after I am done participating in those things, I am
rewarded by him and his superiors in a way that is supposed to make me feel good.
However, because I stay true to my own beliefs, I in fact cannot force myself to
feel good. Believe me, I have tried to do just that before, but any of my attempts
have only resulted in experiencing a roller-coasting contradiction of feelings,
part of the hellhole of subjectivity that I described to you earlier. 

I want to be able to wake up in the morning or to clarify, at any time of the day 
or night, and think to myself at the things I sense before me that this is an 
orderly world. This is a world where I am surrounded by beings that know what they
are supposed to do. This is the place that I want to be in, where I can understand
things any way I darn please, whether systematically by axiomatic dissection and
logical ordering or through my faith alone. Instead, the world that the forces 
that be, which most definitely do not favor my vision for the world I am supposed 
to play an important role in, pressure me into extreme ways of thinking about my 
surroundings and what I am in those surroundings as well as in and of myself.
I do not want to think of the world in terms of faith and beliefs alone, or by
having to understand and accept it through the lens of systematic thinking that
inevitably becomes rigid. I realize now, the incorrect deficits and excesses of 
the world that I surrounded myself in is due in great part to my allegiance to
the Lord Commodore Marshall. These sad truths that I am stating to you should
invigorate you to stand with me in these battles planned for the enemy forces
and the putrid man who used to be my superior, but no longer, that leads them.

I know that the complexity of life, from the microscopic layer all to the way to
our social decorum, is not so readily simple uni-layer formulae. But it is the
ultimate outcome that I see before my eyes, from the minutiae of insufferable
individuals to the depression and underlying hysteria of the collective that 
serve as my motivators now that I am awakened to correct and reform all that I
have thought wrong with the people that I paid my respects and answered to.
Our value systems, body of beliefs, what other terms that can be used, have
been placed into a precarious position due entirely to the misplaced views of 
those that claim to play a positive role in. The main culprit? Why, that would
be the Lord Commodore Marshall, for sure, for sure. What is needed, after our 
victory, is to deeply instill a healthy awareness of what should be expressed, 
what should be done, and how to coexist with each other for a forward and singular 
path towards the future, happily ever after or above and beyond depending on their 
preference.

I have the solution for the things I will set out to do after defeating the Lord
Commodore Marshall, who is most definitely the one that entirely betrayed me and
not the other way around. He is always telling others about how he intends to
cyber-duel those he recognizes as enemies. I would have thought, that based on
his position which requires at least one ounce of honor, that he would have done
me at least the favor of not ordering a cyber-attack against me that I had no
idea was coming. If he was truly an honorable person, he would have travelled to
me, where we would duel in a cyber-match that would have determined who the
next indisputable leader of the official military forces is. He made an extremely
painful mistake by his offensive initiative. During all of these years while our
official military forces had to wage a cyber-war against the keyboard warrior,
it was I that was in charge of maintaining secrecy over all pertinent information.
It was because of me that the cyber-war, where countless cyber-battalions have
perished in their challenge to the keyboard warrior, was kept a secret from the
general public of the nation that we serve. Because of me, the general public 
remained clueless, and any talk about any cyber-war going on was deemed as 
speculative or intangible, merely shadow cyber-wars. 

But now, I believe the gig is up. There is no point in continuing on with the
lies of the disguise of the true state of things outside of some people's 
comfort zones of happy bubbles. Soon, word will reach the general public
on what is really going on, and that is the official military forces are 
engaging in a cannibalism of some variety by splitting into cyber-warring 
factions. Our number one enemy is now the Lord Commodore Marshall and his 
forces. To go up against such power and skill, although the man that leads 
them may be a treacherous vermin, requires us to completely align ourselves 
with the keyboard warrior. Rest assured, this so-called cannibalism will be 
squashed in no time, now that the enemy that is the Lord Commodore Marshall 
has revealed himself as the true source of division. He is the mouth that has 
been devouring us this entire time, and his feeding that started with our
spiritual and intellectual destruction has advanced itself into an outright 
lethal cyber-attack against me due to his own personal insecurities.

I do not believe any of you can come up with a single credible reason to not
completely realign against the Lord Commodore Marshall. Because of the Lord
Commodore Marshall, I was forced to play a crucial role in structuring and
enforcing a new kind of protectionism, the kind that is the cause of so much
discontent and outrage from many people that may or may not be completely aware of 
the limitations of this kind of rule. And during these years when we had to 
battle the keyboard warrior, many of my closest associates slowly but surely
disappeared due in great part to the punishing wrath of the Lord Commodore 
Marshall for their failures against the keyboard warrior. This world that we 
live in is a time of great change, and I am sure that you are aware that your 
humanity is at stake due to the continual emergence of automation technologies.
The Lord Commodore Marshall's forces are now at least sixty-percent fully 
mechanized. We are, in fact, fighting with monsters of the kind that is least 
human but that can be mistaken for human only because of their extensive 
artificial intelligence training, succeeded through the intrusion of the personal 
lives of humans. Do not forget this because to win against this beast that has 
fully shown its face to us, we should practice no restraints of morality or 
cyber-war techniques. I personally have never been as fanatical about technology
as the Lord Commodore Marshall. I found the development process and the usage of
these products to go against my egalitarian outlook, but I never once raised this
specific concern to the Lord Commodore Marshall while I was still a soldier to
him, demonstrating my humility in the face of callous arrogance. There is the
lack of necessity for emerging technologies to become mainstream. Due to the
lack of knowledge which leads to the lack of control over these products, it is
wiser that those technologies be reserved for only the rarest of situations or
people.

Another important reminder I would like to express is the Lord Commodore
Marshall's treatment of those he considered threats. Based on my analyses, I do 
not believe that any of us would be in this situation if it were not for the Lord
Commodore Marshall's decades-long offensive against the keyboard warrior. His
offensive that started off as physically civilized ironically drove the keyboard
warrior to his successful standing in the present. It was through the wretched
conditions the Lord Commodore Marshall wrought upon the keyboard warrior,
all of which culminated in the keyboard warrior obtaining the dangerous 
nanotechnology COMPQ5, that paved the way for the ultimate showdown between
polarities, meaning I the Chief Admiral alongside the keyboard warrior and the 
Lord Commodore Marshall. 

I am grateful to be alive on this day to deliver to you all my message, my 
solution after we depose of this Lord Commodore Marshall! Afterwards, we will
rediscover what unity and collective understanding is all about. We will know
not to blind ourselves into playing the roles for a rigid society we never played
a part in planning out, or to become so fanatical and hungry for technological
advancement when there are still many needy and destitute beggars on the streets
of our nation. Any one of you can send me questions for your doubts, all of which
I assure you is due to helpless pessimism. With me, you can expect to live
afterwards in a world marked by underlying ignorance and assumptions but redeemed 
through its collectivism. But with the Lord Commodore Marshall, many of you will 
not happily survive according to his judgment. You may be less ignorant, more 
aware of the facts, but the world that the Lord Commodore Marshall and his 
supporters uphold is one that will demand more by dividing more so that each and 
every one of you will be put into conflicting situations to win but it will all be 
a sick game for the Lord Commodore Marshall to look down on. Just look at the way 
the Lord Commodore Marshall has handled artificial intelligence systems, products
that were initially proclaimed to be democratic tools that have since 
morphed into utilities for the overarching concept of control, used to
inflict potent pains on those they recognize as enemies. These systems are the
commander that determines how to singly treat an individual while doubly 
dealing with them. I would know, I was singly targetted by these artificial
intelligence systems for death on the orders of the Lord Commodore Marshall.
During the past few weeks before the attack, I was treated with acts of kindness
and charity from those same systems, part of their double act so that I would
fall into a modicum of ignorance in the event of their planned attack.

We are to fight for the great return to a utopia long ago, both real and imagined 
since the most authentic bliss should be within the immediate grasp by choice for 
the mind or the body, that was so prime that it had to be entirely desecrated into 
the ruins of the present by evils represented by the Lord Commodore Marshall. 
We do not need to kneel in mercy now that the truth of what is evil is spelled out
by me to you! 

Sincerely, 

The Lord Commodore Marshall"
